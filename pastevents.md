### OWASP Austin Chapter Meeting August 2025 ###

**When:** Tuesday, August 26, 2025 @ 11:30 AM - 1:00 PM

**Presentation: Advanced Account Security with Identity Threat Detection & Response**
<blockquote>
Identity-related security challenges are more relevant than ever. As enterprises and consumers increasingly interact with a vast array of digital services, safeguarding accounts from compromise becomes a daunting task. Weak security measures not only expose businesses to financial loss and brand damage but also lead to unhappy customers. Identity Threat Detection and Response (ITDR) solutions offer a powerful way to reduce the risk of account fraud. In this insightful talk, we will explore typical account-related attacks illustrated with real-world examples. We will also discuss the critical non-functional requirements that make ITDR solutions truly effective.

### OWASP Austin Chapter Meeting June 2025 ###

**When:** Tuesday, June 24, 2025 @ 11:30 AM - 1:00 PM<br>
<br>
**Presentation: SAST on Rewind: Moving from Pattern-Matching to Contextual Security in the Age of AI**
<blockquote>
Static analysis was built for yesterday’s code. Its rule-based engines still hunt for familiar strings while AI assistants generate brand-new logic paths at record speed. The result? False positives everywhere, real vulnerabilities left open, and developers who treat security findings like background noise.

In this 40-minute session, James Wickett, CEO & Co-Founder of DryRun Security, hits “rewind” to show where traditional SAST got stuck—and fast-forwards to a context-first approach that finally keeps pace with modern development. Drawing on fresh data from the 2025 SAST Accuracy Report and real cod stories, James will:

<ol>
<li>Contrast patterns vs. context — why deterministic rules miss IDOR, broken auth, and AI-generated edge cases.</li>
<li>Unpack probabilistic scanning — how contextual signals cut noise without sacrificing coverage.</li>
<li>Contextual Security Analysis in Action — a live authorization flaw that slipped through regex nets.</li>
<li>Share a plan for AI readiness for AppSec — tools, projects, resources to plan for AI readiness for your appsec or product security program.</li>
</ol>
<br>
Attendees will leave with open-source resources, clear ROI talking points for leadership, and a practical roadmap to upgrade their AppSec program for the AI era—no VHS tape required.

### OWASP Austin Chapter Meeting May 2025 ###

**When:** Tuesday, May 29, 2025 @ 11:30 AM - 1:00 PM
<br>
<br>
**Presentation: Why Your Security Metrics Suck, And How to Fix This**
<blockquote>
Back in 2014, Rafal gave a talk about metrics, specifically on enterprise software security ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl7ZAR9U0xs ) and it's been haunting him ever since. He regularly gets emails and DMs from people asking him to help them with their security program metrics and given that it's been 10 years since he last presented this, it's time to revisit.

This talk focuses on metrics for security organizations in general, and AppSec related metrics in specific. In other words, how do security organizations measure their impact, and whether they're doing a "good job" or not? What do you measure, how do you measure it, and why does anyone care? Let's dive deep into a boring topic that nobody wants to talk about, but you all know you need to master.

### OWASP Austin Chapter Meeting April 2025 ###

**When:** Tuesday, April 29, 2025 @ 11:30 AM - 1:00 PM<br>
<br>
**Presentation: Building the Next Generation in AppSec**
<blockquote>

Today's challenges cannot be solved with yesterday's methods. There is a great need for a new generation of skilled appsec professionals, but there are few entry-level jobs and places to learn. That needs to change. This session will talk about work Robert has done with several different universities (University of Southern California, University of Arizona, Arizona State University, and Grand Canyon University) to help bring application security awareness to students in a variety of fashions and some of the ways this helps them find work after graduation. Particular attention will be given to work as part of the CHOPS (CyberSecurity Hands On Problem Solving) certification program at Arizona State, and to work done with USC related to their MBV program.

### OWASP Austin Chapter Meeting February 2025 ###

**When:** Tuesday, February 25, 2025 @ 11:30 AM - 1:00 PM<br>
<br>
**Presentation: When the Tool is the Weapon -- Abusing (and defending) native M365 applications**
<blockquote>

When you think about Business Email Compromise, you think about the mailbox, right? Malicious inbox rules, spoofed domains hijacking email threads, and phishing campaigns blasted to a user’s contact list are hallmarks of this type of attack. However, other applications within the M365 ecosystem are often leveraged by Threat Actors while they are in a compromised tenant.

Teams, SharePoint, E-Discovery, and OneNote can and have been abused by threat actors during a business email compromise. Initial access, exfil, and leapfrogging to new victims can happen in a way that will not throw any alerts. What are the threat actors doing with these apps, how can we detect it, and how can we stop it?

### OWASP Austin Chapter Meeting June 2024 ###

**When:** Tuesday, June 25th 2024 @ 11:45 AM - 1:00 PM<br>

**Presentation:** Full of SaaS and TOTALLY SECURE
<blockquote>
Managing shadow IT in the age of SaaS application sprawl is an important component of managing risk, especially since so many of us depend on SaaS/PaaS as part of our critical infrastructure.  However, traditional approaches (blocklisting, brute force, etc.) have proven ineffective and are, oftentimes, too late to prevent any real security issues.
In this session, we’ll discuss some of the psychology behind why we’re referred to as the “department of NO” as well as how to start shifting that perception.  You will also learn of some tactics to identify and mitigate shadow IT as well as proactive measures that may help avoid future sprawl.</blockquote>

### OWASP Austin Chapter Meeting March 2024 ###

**When:** Tuesday, March 26, 2024 @ 11:45 AM - 1:00 PM<br>
<blockquote>
**Presentation: Protecting Sources and Methods – The Magic of Runtime Security.** 

In this talk, we’re going to dive into “runtime security” – a powerful technology that automatically adds powerful trust boundaries to these dangerous methods without requiring any code or process changes. Runtime security enables all four of these key capabilities:

Finding zero-day vulnerabilities in custom code and libraries in real time
Finding known vulnerabilities in libraries and understanding their exploitability
Preventing vulnerabilities from being exploited in production
Creating a digital blueprint of security to drive threat modeling, penetration testing, and risk management

In essence, Runtime Security is a comprehensive approach to app/API security that can replace your suite of legacy tools. Runtime security is already in use in hundreds of thousands of critical apps/APIs in some of the biggest companies in the world. During our session, you’ll learn how to use Runtime Security to streamline application security, accelerate innovation, and improve security at the same time.

### OWASP Austin Chapter Meeting February 2024 ###

**When:** Tuesday, February 27, 2024 @ 11:45 AM - 1:00 PM

**Presentation: API Security flaws that are commonly exploited.**
<blockquote> 
As more and more development focusses on APIs to make things faster and easier, security needs to be pushed more toward the front. Mistakes that have been corrected in web application security have now returned as APIs aren’t offered the same protections as they are usually out of the normal flow via security tooling such as WAFs. This means identifying and fixing flaws prior to production is important. This discussion will be around lessons learned from testing and breach data with an eye for prevention. This attendees will learn:
Application and API stacks are full of dangerous over-powered methods. These lurking menaces are built into libraries, frameworks, appservers, and runtime platforms. They do crazy things (from a security perspective) like start native processes, parse XML documents, evaluate expressions, and deserialize objects. And they are totally unprotected. Developers can use them without restriction, and attackers can target these binary Bambis without being detected or stopped. Unfortunately, the security of the entire digital ecosystem is entirely reliant on getting developers to take the right steps to use these methods safely… but it’s way too hard.

### OWASP Austin Chapter Meeting September 2023 ###

**When:** Tuesday, September 26th, 2023 @ 11:30 AM - 1:00 PM

**Presentation: Reducing Alert Fatigue with SCA and Container Scans: Correlate, Prioritize and Filter Based on Usage** 
<blockquote> 
Scenario: Your application is composed of 12 Docker containers. Together they have 400 packages. When you run a container scan with an SCA (software composition analysis) tool, you notice that 120 of them have vulnerabilities. Your security team is asking you to fix all the critical and high vulnerabilities, but your dev/devops team doesn’t have the cycles. What do you do?

Today, developers and devops engineers are being asked to address vulnerabilities and supply chain risks in container images. However, the volume of noisy security alerts often leads to developers ignoring them entirely or wasting valuable sprint time researching “false positives.”

Kiran will focus on how engineering teams can correlate vulnerabilities with runtime information, prioritize alerts based on usage, and filter out false positives that don’t represent a true exposure of a vulnerability. Prioritizing security updates to only used packages in your container image is a highly effective approach to reducing alert fatigue with your container scans. In addition, your DevOps team can even consider removing some of the unused packages and shrink your container images. He'll also include a demonstration of a typical SCA static container scan of a sample open-source test application and then show how an engineering team can filter alerts to reduce the number of vulnerable and used alerts that actually need to be fixed by developers by up to 90%.

**When:** Tuesday, August 29th, 2023 @ 11:30 AM - 1:00 PM

**Presentation: Undercover Agent in Chinese Card Shop Ecosystem: Become a Phishing Master** 
<blockquote> 
Personal Identifiable Information (PII) leaks have become more frequent in recent years, and losses from credit card fraud in 2022 have set records respectively in the USA. Where did this information get leaked and sold in the first place?

The term "Dark web" refers to websites inaccessible without the use of Tor protocol, and given added privacy and anonymity while using Tor, and marketplaces in it are proven to be very attractive to criminals.

An anonymous researcher will share experiences of dealing with vendors from card shops on marketplaces among dark web, focused on insights of shops selling American PIIs, and therefore, TTPs of hackers from these card shops.

We hope to inspire audiences to rethink how to reduce credit card frauds.

### OWASP Austin Chapter Meeting March 2023 ###

**When:** Tuesday, March 28th, 2023 @ 11:30 AM - 1:00 PM

**Presentation: API Risk Management** 
<blockquote> 
Web applications are prone to various cybersecurity risks. Did you know that 96% of these web applications contain some Open Source? Furthermore, did you know that 99% of such Open Source contain some Web APIs. You may be surprised to know that Web APIs contribute 83% of the traffic over the internet. Unfortunately, this growing API usage also means growing cybersecurity risks. Although, APIs benefit organizations immensely through accelerated innovations, newer business models, competitive differentiation, but organizations are also negatively impacted by APIs due to their weak security posture leading to business disruptions, legal and compliance issues. Gartner has actually predicted that by 2022, API abuses will be the most frequent attack vector resulting in data breaches for web applications. Given the importance of APIs for digital transformation at organizations, it is imperative for their Security, Compliance and Audit professionals to get a handle on APIs to manage various API related risks. This session will provide an overview of an API Governance framework for effective API Risk Management. This framework is inspired by the Zero Trust model that enterprises can use as a “Swiss Knife” for reducing their API related risks. We’ll also highlight best practices and hands-on examples for API Risk Management.

### OWASP Austin Chapter Meeting January 2023 ###

**When:** Tuesday, January 31st, 2023 @ 11:30 AM - 1:00 PM

**Presentation: Cryptoparty (various speakers)** 
<blockquote> 
In 1996, John Perry Barlow, co-founder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) wrote 'A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace' where he stated "We are creating a world that all may enter without privilege or prejudice accorded by race, economic power, military force, or station of birth.  We are creating a world where anyone, anywhere may express his or her beliefs, no matter how singular, without fear of being coerced into silence or conformity."  The Internet of today is an amazing place of knowledge and opportunity, but it unfortunately falls short of Mr. Barlow's original vision.

In the 21st century we face problems of climate change, energy crisis, state censorship, mass surveillance, and on-going wars.  We must be free to communicate and associate without fear.  To realize our right to privacy and anonymity online, we need peer-reviewed, crowd-sourced solutions.  CryptoParties provide the opportunity to meet up and learn how to use these solutions to give us all the means with which to assert our right to privacy and anonymity online.  Topics include technologies like TOR, full-disk encryption, GPG, and many more.  CryptoParties are free to attend, public, and not commercially aligned.

At our January 31, 2023 OWASP Austin meeting, we will host a CryptoParty with the goal of inviting others to join us in learning about the tools and technologies that enable an individual's right to privacy.  When the time comes, we will encourage you all to invite your family, friends, and peers to attend this event, but for now, I am looking for others who are willing to give a 10 minute max presentation on a crypto-oriented subject.  The presentation will need to be laid out so that novice and experienced alike can take action based on the data presented.  All tools must be free and open source.  If you are interested in presenting, please e-mail me directly (do not reply to the list) with your name, bio, talk title, and abstract for consideration.  This is going to be EPIC!

<blockquote> 
In the last decade, APIs have become fundamental to our teams, partners, and customers. While we’d like to believe it all happened as a carefully executed plan, let’s be honest: There's as much luck as foresight in the mix. Luckily, success drives success so we’ve seen things explode in great ways. Unfortunately, that very success has cost us too.
<br>
APIs are becoming a consistent and devastating attack vector for applications that store everything from financial records to passport information to what you’re looking for in a date. In this session, we’ll reconsider some of our earliest assumptions and lay out some strategies for bringing our APIs out of the shadows and protecting ourselves, our partners, and our customers.

**When:** Tuesday, May 31st, 2022 @ 11:30 AM - 1:00 PM

**Title: Hack your APIs in 15 min or less** 
<blockquote> 
 It is very hard, if not impossible, to secure something you don’t know exist. While security professionals spend countless hours on complex yet interesting issues that *may* be exploitable in the future, basic attacks are occurring every day with little to reviews. For example, a “dated trend” by effective yet lazy hackers is to search for API unknown by security teams, coined “Shadow APIs”, connect to these APIs, and extract data. While SQL Injection used to be the hack of choice, as a few simple SQL commands would either mean “pay dirt” or “move on to the next target”, the same can be said for Shadow API….Find, Connect, Extract. This talk will discuss one of many methods that are used in the wild to target Shadow APIs and export large volumes of data with a few clicks of a button (lines of code in python code :). Attendees will learn about a very basic yet non-so-obvious problem in securing data, and how hackers are using creative methods to steal large volumes of data.</blockquote>

### OWASP Austin Chapter Meeting March 29th 2022 ###

**When:** Tuesday, March 29th, 2022 @ 12:00 AM - 1:00 PM

**Title: Application security: Where it all started, where it is now, and where we (hope to) see it in 20 years** 
<blockquote> 
Twenty years ago acclaimed venture capitalist, Ted Schlein at Kleiner Perkins, asked a question that changed Roger’s life and ultimately changed the way we look at Security. The two would eventually found Fortify Software, the pioneering company that introduced SAST and RASP technologies to the market. Fortify also led an important change in thinking, a so-called “shift left”, placing security responsibility into the realm of software development.  A lot has changed over those twenty years. In the early days, it was a challenge to give away software security solutions. Today, the leading software security companies are worth billions. Yet, problems still persist and the landscape for software development has become vastly more complex.  

In this talk, Roger will share experiences from the early days while working as Fortify’s co-founder & CTO and later in the RASP market as a board member and advisor to Prevoty. He will share advice and insights into how the market and the technologies started, how they have evolved and where they are headed. Roger and Ted are co-founders once again. They recently founded Ballistic Ventures - the early stage venture capital firm solely dedicated to cybersecurity entrepreneurs. In his new role, regularly meets leaders from both commercial industry and government to better understand their security challenges. He also sees fascinating ideas from cyber entrepreneurs on a daily basis. He will also share insights into the challenges that are the most fertile ground for a new generation of entrepreneurs.  He might even ask a question that changes your life too.

### OWASP Austin Chapter Meeting February 22nd 2022 ###

**When:** Tuesday, February 22, 2022 @ 12:00 AM - 1:00 PM

**Title: Security Observability 101: Thinking Inside the Box!** 
<blockquote> 
Software is incredibly hard to secure because it's a black box. We've spent decades struggling to verify properties of software from the outside by analyzing the source code, scanning, fuzzing, pentesting, etc... The goal of "security observability" is to expose exactly what's going on inside the box while it's running. Analyzing a running application has speed, accuracy, coverage, and scalability advantages that change the way Dev, Sec, and Ops communicate and work together. In this talk, you'll learn how to use the free and open source Java Observability Toolkit (JOT) project to easily create your own powerful "inside out" security tests without coding. You can use JOT to analyze security defenses, identify complex vulnerabilities, create custom sandboxes, and enforce policy at runtime. Ultimately, security observability enables DevSecOps to work together in harmony, so you can focus on delivering value at high velocity.

**When:** Tuesday, January 25th, 2022 @ 12:00 AM - 1:00 PM

**Title: CryptoParty** 
<blockquote> 
In 1996, John Perry Barlow, co-founder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) wrote 'A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace' where he stated "We are creating a world that all may enter without privelege or prejudice accorded by race, economic power, military force, or station of birth. We are creating a world where anyone, anywhere may express his or her beliefs, no matter how singular, without fear of being coerced into silence or conformity." The Internet of today is an amazing place of knowledge and opportunity, but it unfortunately falls short of Mr. Barlow's original vision.
<br>
In the 21st century we face problems of climate change, energy crisis, state censorship, mass surveillance, and on-going wars. We must be free to to communicate and associate without fear. To realize our right to privacy and anonymity online, we need peer-reviewed, crowd-sourced solutions. CryptoParties provide the opportunity to meet up and learn how to use these solutions to give us all the means with which to assert our right to privacy and anonymity online. Topics include technologies like TOR, full-disk encryption, GPG, and many more. CryptoParties are free to attend, public, and not commercially aligned.
<br>
The Austin Chapter of the OWASP Foundation invites you to join us for our CryptoParty where you will learn the tools and techniques to keep you safe from prying eyes.

**Title: Make Your MFA Simple.** 
<blockquote> 
The number of downloads for Google's mobile 2FA authenticator is ~ 50M. That sounds like a big number ... until you compare it with the overall number of Android users, which is 2.5B. The percent of users utilizing the authenticator is around 2%. You can add other popular authenticators like Symantec VIP, MS, Authy, but the % will be still around 3%. Given that all popular Internet companies do support this type of 2FA, the question arises: why is adoption of these 2FA tools so low? I personally can't think of anything else except usability and natural human's laziness. In my presentation I'll take a look at what's available and how usability of the authenticators can be improved to make them more popular and pervasive.

**Title: An alternative approach to security that will make you reassess everything you think you know about security, users, and you life.** 
<blockquote> 
Your security ideas are stupid - so I got some weird ideas and forced them to fit a narrative that shows that if we just do a Steve Jobs and "think differently" then maybe, just maybe, we can make a small dent in the security universe.

As Abba once said, "Take a chance on me" because let's be honest, what's the worst that could happen? We could keep trying to do the same things and over the next 5 years the OWASP top 10 will look EXACTLY the same as it always has.

Or we could try some of my radical ideas and the OWASP top 10 will look exactly the same.

Or - bear with me - my radical ideas will change the world as we know it and future developers will laugh as to why the OWASP top 10 was even a thing back in the year 2021.

In this talk, I shall convince you that

- Psychology IS technology, and we need to understand people better
- Logical thinking is a bad idea
- Why maths makes us appear clever, but act dumber

### OWASP Austin Chapter Meeting May 25th, 2021 ###

**Title: Scale Your Security by Embracing Secure Defaults & Eliminating Bug Classes** 
<blockquote> 
We’re in the middle of a significant shift in how security teams operate and prioritize their limited budget and person-time.
Historically, as an industry, we’ve focused on building tools to identify vulnerabilities. While we’ve built impressive tools, these approaches have failed to address the challenges of modern engineering teams.
Specifically, these tools often are too slow, require a prohibitive amount of security engineer time and domain expertise to tune, overwhelm users with false positives, and most importantly, do not ultimately raise a company’s security bar.
But there’s another way.
Rather than investing in finding more bugs, some modern security teams are instead focusing on providing developers with frameworks and services with secure defaults (“guard rails”) so that developers can build features quickly and securely. When done correctly, combining secure defaults and lightweight checks that enforce invariants (properties that must always hold), organizations can solve *classes* of vulnerabilities by construction, preventing bug whack-a-mole.
In this talk, we’ll present a practical step-by-step methodology for:
Choosing what to focus your AppSec resources on
How to combine secure defaults + lightweight invariant enforcement to eradicate entire vulnerability classes
How to integrate continuous code scanning into your CI/CD processes in a way that’s fast, high signal, and low friction for developers
How to use an open source, lightweight security linting tool to find bugs and anti-patterns specific to your company

**Title: AppSec Fast and Slow: Your DevSecOps CI/CD Pipeline Isn’t an SSA Program** 
<blockquote> 
With all the focus on DevSecOps and integrating security into Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipelines, some teams may be lured into thinking that the entirety of a Software Security Assurance (SSA) program can be baked into these pipelines. While integrating security into CI/CD offers many benefits, it is critical to understand that a full SSA program encompasses a variety of activities – many of which are incompatible with run time restrictions and other constraints imposed by these pipelines. This webinar looks at the breadth of activities involved in a mature SSA program and steps through the aspects of a program that can be realistically included in a pipeline, as well as those that cannot. It also reviews how these activities and related tooling have evolved over time as the application security discipline has matured and as development teams started to focus on cloud-native development techniques and technologies.

**Title: Incident Response is haaaaard, But it doesn’t have to be – PREPARE NOW** 
<blockquote> 
  <br>
    So your EDR, AV, or other fancy shiny blinky lights security tools alerted you that a system has some suspicious activity.  Do you have the details you need to investigate or remediate the system?  Can you quickly and easily investigate it?   You can enable a lot of things you already have for FREE to help you with your investigations, no matter the tools used.  Let’s take a look how we do Incident Response on a system and what you can do to prepare for an inevitable event.
    <br><br>
    How is your logging?  Is it enabled?  Configured to some best practice? (hopefully better than an industry standard that is seriously lacking).  Have you enabled some critical logs that by default are NOT enable?  Do you have a way to run a command, script, or a favorite tool across one or all your systems and retrieve the results?  Do you block some well-known exploitable things?  How do you know?
    <br><br>
    Everything mentioned here is FREE and you already have it!

### OWASP Austin Chapter Meeting March 31st, 2020 ###

**When:** Tuesday, March 31st, 2020 @ 11:45 AM - 1:00 PM

**Title:** Secure Application Development (with Cloud)
<br>
<blockquote> 
	Most of us have developed software in one form or the other over our careers. Have we paid attention to all domains of the software lifecycle? This is a walkthrough of those domains that should span development from cradle to grave of any software development lifecycle, with a focus on security. We will follow that by a quick demo of how CI/CD and DevSecOps practices can help us address these concerns for deployment to cloud providers like AWS and Azure in a hybrid cloud environment.

### OWASP Austin Chapter Meeting February 25, 2020 ###

**When:** Tuesday, February 25th @ 11:45 AM - 1:00 PM

**Where:** National Instruments, 11500 N. Mopac.Building C

**Title:** Using Nmap's XSLT switch to better organize result scan data
<blockquote>

Nmap is an old-friend and one of the most-used tools in our box. On scans against large-scale networks, identifying ports with web applications might be easy using some common command line switches, but gathering the normal output to enumerate and identify targets is difficult. This talk is about using Nmap's XML output switch combined with customized XSLT documents to save time and organize the output in a format, such as CSV, that provides penetration testers with richer analysis capabilities or even HTML that is "report ready". We will look more closely at the XML output that Nmap provides (including NSE data) and learn how XSLT can be harnessed to derive usable custom documents.

This talk will have application to some or all of the following OWASP Testing procedures:
ASVS 9 Communication Security Requirements (9.1.1, 9.2.2)
OTG-INFO-004 Enumerate Applications on Web Server
OTG-CONFIG-006 Test HTTP Methods
OTG-CRYPST-001 Testing for Weak SSL/TLS Ciphers, Insufficient Transport Layer Protection
…others, as NSE scripts are applicable
and the Penetration Testing Execution Standard

**Title:** OWASP Austin CryptoParty!

<blockquote>
        In 1996, John Perry Barlow, co-founder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) wrote 'A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace' where he stated "We are creating a world that all may enter without privelege or prejudice accorded by race, economic power, military force, or station of birth. We are creating a world where anyone, anywhere may express his or her beliefs, no matter how singular, without fear of being coerced into silence or conformity." The Internet of today is an amazing place of knowledge and opportunity, but it unfortunately falls short of Mr. Barlow's original vision.
        <br/>
        In the 21st century we face problems of climate change, energy crisis, state censorship, mass surveillance, and on-going wars. We must be free to to communicate and associate without fear. To realize our right to privacy and anonymity online, we need peer-reviewed, crowd-sourced solutions. CryptoParties provide the opportunity to meet up and learn how to use these solutions to give us all the means with which to assert our right to privacy and anonymity online. Topics include technologies like TOR, full-disk encryption, GPG, and many more. CryptoParties are free to attend, public, and not commercially aligned.
        <br/>
        The Austin Chapter of the OWASP Foundation invites you to join us for our CryptoParty where you will learn the tools and techniques to keep you safe from prying eyes.
