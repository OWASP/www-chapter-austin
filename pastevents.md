### OWASP Austin Chapter Meeting February 22nd 2022 ###

**When:** Tuesday, February 22, 2022 @ 12:00 AM - 1:00 PM

**Title: Security Observability 101: Thinking Inside the Box!** 
<blockquote> 
Software is incredibly hard to secure because it's a black box. We've spent decades struggling to verify properties of software from the outside by analyzing the source code, scanning, fuzzing, pentesting, etc... The goal of "security observability" is to expose exactly what's going on inside the box while it's running. Analyzing a running application has speed, accuracy, coverage, and scalability advantages that change the way Dev, Sec, and Ops communicate and work together. In this talk, you'll learn how to use the free and open source Java Observability Toolkit (JOT) project to easily create your own powerful "inside out" security tests without coding. You can use JOT to analyze security defenses, identify complex vulnerabilities, create custom sandboxes, and enforce policy at runtime. Ultimately, security observability enables DevSecOps to work together in harmony, so you can focus on delivering value at high velocity.

### OWASP Austin Chapter Meeting January 26th, 2021 ###

**When:** Tuesday, January 25th, 2022 @ 12:00 AM - 1:00 PM

**Title: CryptoParty** 
<blockquote> 
In 1996, John Perry Barlow, co-founder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) wrote 'A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace' where he stated "We are creating a world that all may enter without privelege or prejudice accorded by race, economic power, military force, or station of birth. We are creating a world where anyone, anywhere may express his or her beliefs, no matter how singular, without fear of being coerced into silence or conformity." The Internet of today is an amazing place of knowledge and opportunity, but it unfortunately falls short of Mr. Barlow's original vision.
<br>
In the 21st century we face problems of climate change, energy crisis, state censorship, mass surveillance, and on-going wars. We must be free to to communicate and associate without fear. To realize our right to privacy and anonymity online, we need peer-reviewed, crowd-sourced solutions. CryptoParties provide the opportunity to meet up and learn how to use these solutions to give us all the means with which to assert our right to privacy and anonymity online. Topics include technologies like TOR, full-disk encryption, GPG, and many more. CryptoParties are free to attend, public, and not commercially aligned.
<br>
The Austin Chapter of the OWASP Foundation invites you to join us for our CryptoParty where you will learn the tools and techniques to keep you safe from prying eyes.

### OWASP Austin Chapter Meeting July 27th, 2021 ###

**Title: Make Your MFA Simple.** 
<blockquote> 
The number of downloads for Google's mobile 2FA authenticator is ~ 50M. That sounds like a big number ... until you compare it with the overall number of Android users, which is 2.5B. The percent of users utilizing the authenticator is around 2%. You can add other popular authenticators like Symantec VIP, MS, Authy, but the % will be still around 3%. Given that all popular Internet companies do support this type of 2FA, the question arises: why is adoption of these 2FA tools so low? I personally can't think of anything else except usability and natural human's laziness. In my presentation I'll take a look at what's available and how usability of the authenticators can be improved to make them more popular and pervasive.

### OWASP Austin Chapter Meeting June 29th, 2021 ###

**Title: An alternative approach to security that will make you reassess everything you think you know about security, users, and you life.** 
<blockquote> 
Your security ideas are stupid - so I got some weird ideas and forced them to fit a narrative that shows that if we just do a Steve Jobs and "think differently" then maybe, just maybe, we can make a small dent in the security universe.

As Abba once said, "Take a chance on me" because let's be honest, what's the worst that could happen? We could keep trying to do the same things and over the next 5 years the OWASP top 10 will look EXACTLY the same as it always has.

Or we could try some of my radical ideas and the OWASP top 10 will look exactly the same.

Or - bear with me - my radical ideas will change the world as we know it and future developers will laugh as to why the OWASP top 10 was even a thing back in the year 2021.

In this talk, I shall convince you that

- Psychology IS technology, and we need to understand people better
- Logical thinking is a bad idea
- Why maths makes us appear clever, but act dumber

### OWASP Austin Chapter Meeting May 25th, 2021 ###

**Title: Scale Your Security by Embracing Secure Defaults & Eliminating Bug Classes** 
<blockquote> 
We’re in the middle of a significant shift in how security teams operate and prioritize their limited budget and person-time.
Historically, as an industry, we’ve focused on building tools to identify vulnerabilities. While we’ve built impressive tools, these approaches have failed to address the challenges of modern engineering teams.
Specifically, these tools often are too slow, require a prohibitive amount of security engineer time and domain expertise to tune, overwhelm users with false positives, and most importantly, do not ultimately raise a company’s security bar.
But there’s another way.
Rather than investing in finding more bugs, some modern security teams are instead focusing on providing developers with frameworks and services with secure defaults (“guard rails”) so that developers can build features quickly and securely. When done correctly, combining secure defaults and lightweight checks that enforce invariants (properties that must always hold), organizations can solve *classes* of vulnerabilities by construction, preventing bug whack-a-mole.
In this talk, we’ll present a practical step-by-step methodology for:
Choosing what to focus your AppSec resources on
How to combine secure defaults + lightweight invariant enforcement to eradicate entire vulnerability classes
How to integrate continuous code scanning into your CI/CD processes in a way that’s fast, high signal, and low friction for developers
How to use an open source, lightweight security linting tool to find bugs and anti-patterns specific to your company

### OWASP Austin Chapter Meeting February 23, 2021 ###

**Title: AppSec Fast and Slow: Your DevSecOps CI/CD Pipeline Isn’t an SSA Program** 
<blockquote> 
With all the focus on DevSecOps and integrating security into Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipelines, some teams may be lured into thinking that the entirety of a Software Security Assurance (SSA) program can be baked into these pipelines. While integrating security into CI/CD offers many benefits, it is critical to understand that a full SSA program encompasses a variety of activities – many of which are incompatible with run time restrictions and other constraints imposed by these pipelines. This webinar looks at the breadth of activities involved in a mature SSA program and steps through the aspects of a program that can be realistically included in a pipeline, as well as those that cannot. It also reviews how these activities and related tooling have evolved over time as the application security discipline has matured and as development teams started to focus on cloud-native development techniques and technologies.

**Title: Incident Response is haaaaard, But it doesn’t have to be – PREPARE NOW** 
<blockquote> 
  <br>
    So your EDR, AV, or other fancy shiny blinky lights security tools alerted you that a system has some suspicious activity.  Do you have the details you need to investigate or remediate the system?  Can you quickly and easily investigate it?   You can enable a lot of things you already have for FREE to help you with your investigations, no matter the tools used.  Let’s take a look how we do Incident Response on a system and what you can do to prepare for an inevitable event.
    <br><br>
    How is your logging?  Is it enabled?  Configured to some best practice? (hopefully better than an industry standard that is seriously lacking).  Have you enabled some critical logs that by default are NOT enable?  Do you have a way to run a command, script, or a favorite tool across one or all your systems and retrieve the results?  Do you block some well-known exploitable things?  How do you know?
    <br><br>
    Everything mentioned here is FREE and you already have it!
    <br><br>
    This talk will describe these things and how to prepare, and be PREPARED to do incident Response, yes, even for DevOps.  A few tools will be discussed as well that you can use to speed things up.
    <br><br>
    The attendee can take the information from this talk and immediately start improving their environment to prepare for the inevitable, an incident.

On scans against large-scale networks, identifying ports with web applications might be easy using some common command line switches, but gathering the normal output to enumerate and identify targets is difficult. This talk is about using Nmap's XML output switch combined with customized XSLT documents to save time and organize the output in a format, such as CSV, that provides penetration testers with richer analysis capabilities or even HTML that is "report ready". We will look more closely at the XML output that Nmap provides (including NSE data) and learn how XSLT can be harnessed to derive usable custom documents.

This talk will have application to some or all of the following OWASP Testing procedures:
ASVS 9 Communication Security Requirements (9.1.1, 9.2.2)
OTG-INFO-004 Enumerate Applications on Web Server
OTG-CONFIG-006 Test HTTP Methods
OTG-CRYPST-001 Testing for Weak SSL/TLS Ciphers, Insufficient Transport Layer Protection
…others, as NSE scripts are applicable
and the Penetration Testing Execution Standard

**Title:** OWASP Austin CryptoParty!

<blockquote>
        In 1996, John Perry Barlow, co-founder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) wrote 'A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace' where he stated "We are creating a world that all may enter without privelege or prejudice accorded by race, economic power, military force, or station of birth. We are creating a world where anyone, anywhere may express his or her beliefs, no matter how singular, without fear of being coerced into silence or conformity." The Internet of today is an amazing place of knowledge and opportunity, but it unfortunately falls short of Mr. Barlow's original vision.
        <br/>
        In the 21st century we face problems of climate change, energy crisis, state censorship, mass surveillance, and on-going wars. We must be free to to communicate and associate without fear. To realize our right to privacy and anonymity online, we need peer-reviewed, crowd-sourced solutions. CryptoParties provide the opportunity to meet up and learn how to use these solutions to give us all the means with which to assert our right to privacy and anonymity online. Topics include technologies like TOR, full-disk encryption, GPG, and many more. CryptoParties are free to attend, public, and not commercially aligned.
        <br/>
        The Austin Chapter of the OWASP Foundation invites you to join us for our CryptoParty where you will learn the tools and techniques to keep you safe from prying eyes.

**When:** Tuesday, September 24th @ 11:45 AM - 1:00 PM

**Where:** National Instruments, 11500 N. Mopac.Building C

**Title:** OAuth 2.0 Misimplementation, Vulnerabilities and Best Practices

<blockquote>OAuth 2.0 is an authorization framework that enables third party applications to obtain temporary limited authorization to access a protected resource on behalf of a resource owner. The framework is defined by authorization interactions that are each scoped to the type of client obtaining authorization and the type or types of resource owners that must grant access. Diverging from these defined scopes can open up various interception and redirect attack vectors that can grant a malicious actor access to protected resources. For this talk, we will be discussing Public Clients vs Confidential Clients, User Authentication vs Client Authentication, Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) for Public Clients, and how restricting certain OAuth flows to either Public or Confidential Clients is required to mitigate unauthorized access to protected resources.</blockquote>

**Speaker:** Pak Foley

<blockquote>Pak Foley is a Security Engineer at Procore Technologies. He has specialized in Identity and Access Management with a focus on architecting enterprise OAuth and SAML solutions for authentication and authorization throughout distributed systems. With a passion for OAuth in particular, he has spent much of his time seeking out and mitigating vulnerabilities from misimplemented OAuth solutions and contributed to the open source Rails OAuth provider, Doorkeeper. His passion for securing web applications has prompted his recent move from IAM to security.</blockquote>

**Where:** Norris Conference Center, 2525 W. Anderson Lane, Suite 365, Austin TX 78757

**Title:** A Standards-Based Approach to Assessing Your Organization's Cybersecurity Maturity

<blockquote>We were tasked with creating a roadmap for the National Instruments Information Security Program. While we had previously used a Gartner Maturity Model to figure out how far along our organization was, we found their recommendations to be too high level to define an actionable roadmap. After some discussion, we determined that we could use the NIST Cybersecurity Framework to not only assess our maturity, but also define risk in our environment, and create a roadmap. This talk will not only show you how we did it, but how you can do it too!</blockquote>

**Speaker:** Josh Sokol and Alex Polimeni

<blockquote>Josh Sokol, CISSP, graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with a BS in Computer Science in 2002.

**When:** Tuesday, September 25th @ 11:45 AM - 1:00 PM 

**Where:** National Instruments, 11500 N. Mopac.Building C

**Title:** Scaling Your Cyber Security Threat Modeling

<blockquote>There are two schools of thought around threat modeling. One school advocates the creation of attack trees and data flow diagrams. This requires extensive, cross-functional, security skills and is not a scalable approach. The other school encourages organic insertion of defenses based only on current context without “boiling the ocean”. This lack of systems thinking leaves applications vulnerable as exploits in a weaker component can open the door to critical systems.

Part of the problem is threat modeling today is largely an art. We need to inject more science in this domain and derive a repeatable and auditable approach that maps to risk. Such a model should abstract away the non-scalable elements and still provide a high degree of assurance in today’s faster velocity business context.

This presentation will outline a threat modeling framework that abstracts traditional methods into systems, data, and people components. You will come away with an approach that takes away some of the scalability problems of traditional threat modeling, yet provides sufficient rigor and systems thinking to help manage risk.</blockquote>

**Speaker:**  Pranoy De - Software Engineer

<blockquote>Pranoy currently works as a backend developer at Security Compass, helping to develop industry-leading application security products. Over the years, Pranoy has taken on a variety of roles, which included working as a software consultant, working as a network engineer, and writing software for the VFX industry.

**Where:** National Instruments, 11500 N. Mopac.Building C

**Title:** DevSecOps Unplugged (Results from our latest research on DevSecOps)

<blockquote>There is a confluence of forces that disrupt the ability for organizations to implement DevSecOps effectively. We continue to increase our dependence on software but teams are still relatively immature in developing securely. Our systems continue to grow exponentially complex. With IoT starting to take off, there is no clear industry vision for security these devices. Cybersecurity threats continue to rise. Even the most diligent teams find themselves subtly gaining technical debt because they are unable to do the job right.
 
This impact is felt across industries: telecommunications, financial, software development, transportation, and medical just to name a few. So what is our response as security professionals? We have software tools and databases like OWASP Top 10, CWE/CVE, SANS Top 25 and so on. But what we need is a set of patterns and anti-patterns on implementing DevSecOps.
 
Our talk will highlight what we’ve observed in conducting research from Tier 1 peer reviewed articles from 2016 to the present. We will present what seems to be emerging as a set of best practices as well as anti-patterns in DevSecOps.</blockquote>

**Title:** Privacy-Preserving Authentication, Another Reason to Care about Zero-Knowledge Proofs

<blockquote>You can ignore the Blockchain hype for identity solutions, it is superb marketing; but suboptimal technology. You can also ignore biometrics for a spell. Instead, the real breakthroughs, especially in authentication, will be based on elegant math and crypto, e.g., Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP). These have the added benefit of being privacy-preserving, and amenable to user control of identity attributes. ZKP has been identified as a category for many other solutions in the future, not just identity. Conceived at MIT in 1985 by Shafi Goldwasser, ZKP is still young. You will see it in many other contexts as appreciation and recognition evolves.</blockquote>

**Speaker:** Clare Nelson, CISSP, CIPP/E

<blockquote>Clare's focus combines security, privacy, and identity. Her middle name is MFA, and she loves all things identity. She forges identity solution roadmaps and tracks emerging technologies, especially in light of EU regulations including GDPR and PSD2.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Clare’s early technical background includes software development of encrypted TCP/IP variants for NSA. She has held leadership positions in product management, marketing, and technology for companies including EMC2, Dell, Novell, and TeaLeaf Technology (IBM).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Clare is a co-founder of the mentoring organization, C1ph3r_Qu33ns. She headed ClearMark Consulting for 14 years, and she is currently Director, Office of the CTO at AllClear ID.  She has a B.S. in Mathematics from Tufts University, and is a lifelong fitness enthusiast.</blockquote>

**Title:** Frontline Web App Security
 
<blockquote>According to the Verizon DBIR (Data Breach Investigation Report) for 2016, web application attacks are the #1 source of data breaches. Web applications account for only 8 percent of overall reported incidents. However, attacks on web applications accounted for over 40 percent of incidents resulting in a data breach, and were the single-biggest source of data loss.</blockquote>

<blockquote>With those threats in mind, it has never been more important to ensure that companies have visibility into what is happening with their web apps. The most effective way to address application flaws and preemptively block unknown attacks is to have a close relationship with your web application firewall.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Static, signature based blocking is not enough to address never before seen attacks. In this talk, we will walk through scenarios that we have observed, talk about coding practices that enable your web app to be secured, and describe the steps that are taken to defend against critical web applications attacks.</blockquote>

**Speakers:** Paul Scott and Jason Payne

<blockquote>Paul Scott is an OWASP Houston chapter leader and the Manager of Alert Logic’s Web Application Security Team.  Jason Payne ran the Alert Logic Global Security Operations Center for nearly a decade and is now engineering solutions to defend systems, networks, and application on premises and in the cloud.</blockquote>

**Title:** DevSecOps Lessons from Detroit to Deming

<blockquote>In 1982, the city of Detroit saw 15,000 vehicles roll off its production lines every day.  To achieve this goal, Detroit's line workers were being measured on velocity, often at the expense of quality.  At the same time, auto workers in Japan -- applying lessons from W. Edwards Deming -- were implementing new supply chain management practices which enabled them to manufacture higher quality vehicles, for less cost, at higher velocity.  As a result, from 1962 to 1982, the Detroit auto industry lost 20% of its domestic market to Japan. 

The parallels between the auto industry of 35 years ago and software development practices in place today are remarkable.  DevOps teams around the world are consuming billions of open source components and containerized applications to improve productivity at a massive scale. The good news: they are accelerating time to market. The bad news: many of the components and containers they are using are fraught with defects including critical security vulnerabilities. 

This session aimed to enlighten Security, DevOps,  and development professionals by sharing results from the 2017 State of the Software Supply Chain Report -- a blend of public and proprietary data with expert research and analysis. The presentation also revealed findings from the 2017 DevSecOps Community survey where over 2,200 professionals shared their experiences blending DevOps and security practices together.  Throughout the discussion, Derek shared lessons that Deming employed decades ago to help us accelerate adoption of the right DevSecOps culture, practices, and measures today.
</blockquote>

**Speaker:** Derek E. Weeks

<blockquote>After flying to 40 countries and racing through a half-Ironman competition, Derek woke up one morning on the top of Kilimanjaro and saw the world in a new light. Soon after, Derek become a huge advocate of applying proven supply chain management principles into AppSec practices to improve efficiencies and sustain long-lasting competitive advantages. He currently serves as vice president and DevSecOps advocate at Sonatype, creators of the Nexus repository manager and the global leader in solutions for software supply chain automation.  Derek is also the co-founder of the All Day DevOps conference and the lead researcher behind the annual State of the Software Supply Chain report.</blockquote>
