## Sponsorship Opportunities with our Chapter ##

The Austin OWASP Chapter can offer your company several sponsorship opportunities. If you are interested in taking advantage of any of these opportunities, please contact Tiana Chandler (tiana[dot]chandler[at]owasp.org), the OWASP Austin Chapter Sponsor Coordinator. 

### Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour Sponsorship ### 

The Austin OWASP Chapter organizes a monthly Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour event along with the Capitol of Texas ISSA Chapter. This event has historically drawn around 40 of Austin's finest security professionals for networking and more. Your sponsorship of this event includes appetizers and drinks for the attendees.  Feel free to pass out business cards and network just like you would anywhere else. You'll find no better opportunity to get your name in front of 40+ security professionals for around $750 - $1000.

### Lonestar Application Security Conference (LASCON) Sponsorship ### 

The Lonestar Application Security Conference (LASCON) is an OWASP conference held annually in Austin, TX. It is a gathering of 400+ web app developers, security engineers, mobile developers and information security professionals. LASCON is held in Texas where more Fortune 500 companies call home than any other state and it is held in Austin which is a hub for startups in the state of Texas. At LASCON, leaders at these companies along with security architects and developers gather to share cutting-edge ideas, initiatives, and technology advancements.

Being a non-profit organization, we rely mostly on sponsorships to help us provide the funding to make LASCON successful.

**Other opportunities not currently needed, but may seek on occasion**

### OWASP Meeting Lunch Sponsorship ### 

Our monthly Austin OWASP meetings are held during a person's typical lunch hours from 11:30 AM to 1:00 PM. For your sponsorship of around $750 we can arrange food and drinks for up to 60 attendees. In exchange for your sponsorship, our chapter will provide you with 5 minutes at the start of the meeting to introduce yourself and tell us about the products or services that your company offers. You'll also receive mention of being the lunch sponsor in all e-mail communications about the meeting. 

### OWASP Meeting Presenter Sponsorship ### 

Although OWASP is a non-profit organization, we strive to provide our members with the best presenters we possibly can. While the Austin area has tons of security talent, sometimes it's worthwhile to reach beyond our borders to pull in more awesome presenters. In exchange for covering travel expenses for these presenters, our chapter will provide you with 5 minutes at the start of the meeting to introduce yourself and tell us about the products or services that your company offers. You'll also receive mention of being the presenter sponsor in all e-mail communications about the meeting.
