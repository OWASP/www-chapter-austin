**When:** Tuesday, May 31st @ 11:45 - 1PM

**Where:** National Instruments, 11500 North Mopac Expressway, Building C, Austin, TX 78759

**Title:** The ABCs of Source-Assisted Web Application Penetration Testing With OWASP ZAP: Attack Surface, Backdoors, and Configuration

<blockquote>
There are a number of reasons to use source code to assist in web application penetration testing such as making better use of penetration testers’ time, providing penetration testers with deeper insight into system behavior, and highlighting specific sections of so development teams can remediate vulnerabilities faster. Examples of these are provided using the open source ThreadFix plugin for the OWASP ZAP proxy and dynamic application security testing tool. These show opportunities attendees have to enhance their own penetration tests given access to source code.

This presentation covers the “ABCs” of source code assisted web application penetration testing: covering issues of attack surface enumeration, backdoor identification, and configuration issue discovery. Having access to the source lets an attacker enumerate all of the URLs and parameters an application exposes – essentially its attack surface. Knowing these allows pen testers greater application coverage during testing. In addition, access to source code can help to identify potential backdoors that have been intentionally added to the system. Comparing the results of blind spidering to a full attack surface model can identify items of interest such as hidden admin consoles or secret backdoor parameters. Finally, the presentation examines how access to source code can help identify configuration settings that may have an adverse impact on the security of the deployed application.

**When:** Tuesday, March 29th @ 11:45 - 1PM

**Where:** National Instruments, 11500 N. Mopac.Building C

**Title:** Lean Security

<blockquote>
Moving fast is a business imperative that you can’t afford to be in opposition to. Lean, DevOps and Continuous Delivery philosophies hinge on the ability to move fast through collaboration, automation, and aligning with the flow of the organization. Security needs to be able to make the same transformation.

As a concrete example of applying these approaches to security, we will show how a platform automation approach to security increases transparency and visibility throughout the organization and pairs with the high-throughput philosophies of DevOps and Continuous Delivery, while working with the way the business functions and not against it.

From this session, you will: 

* Understand the Lean, Agile, and DevOps techniques emerging in organizations today
* Be armed with organizational strategies for bridging devops and security
* Apply Lean thinking to security operations.

**When:** Tuesday, February 23rd @ 11:45 - 1PM

**Where:** National Instruments, 11500 N. Mopac.Building C

**Title:** Rugged DevOps Using Gauntlt

Writing code that works is hard. Writing rugged code that can stand the test of time is even harder. This difficulty is often compounded by crunched timelines and fast cycles that prioritize new features. Add in evolving business needs and new technology and it becomes confusing to know what to do and how to integrate security into your application.

This workshop brings in some of the top developers and application security practitioners to help you ruggedize your end-to-end development lifecycle from code commit to running system.

Three Takeaways: 
# You will learn pragmatic approaches and tooling that will affect your development processes and delivery pipelines.
# Armed with tools and ideas for monitoring your operational and runtime security.
# You will walk away with code examples and tools that you can put into practice right away for security and rugged testing.

Bring a laptop (mac or linux) that you can install software on and a github account.

### OWASP Austin Chapter Meeting, September 29th ###

**When:** Tuesday, September 29th @ 11:45 - 1PM

**Title:** Log Everything, even if it is just on local disks

Logs are as important as SQLi, XSS or Secure Coding!  OWASP has a “Logging Cheat Sheet”, and there are the “Windows Logging Cheat Sheet”, “Windows PowerShell Logging Cheat Sheet”, “Windows Splunk Logging Cheat Sheet” and several other I created, but we still lack an understanding of logging when it comes to Application Security and DevOps.
 
Enabling and configuration of logs must become as basic and a standard practice as doing WebApp security scans, secure code reviews or secure webapp design, which should include application log design and implementation.  You don’t need an expensive log management solution to do good application security or DevOps log configuration.  What we need is to include all our Cheat Sheets into DevOps builds so enabling and configuration is baked in and to include a log design review as a part of our application secure reviews.  So WHEN we need log data, it is there for us.

### OWASP Austin Chapter Meeting, August 25th ###

**Title:** Eat Your Own Dogfood

As security professionals, we have made it our jobs to tell other people how to be secure.  We preach security in everything from applications to systems to networks and more.  We get more and more frustrated with each and every issue that we find and sometimes even angry when others aren't fixing things fast enough.  But, with all of the berating that we do of others for their security downfalls, how many of us actually put in the time and effort to do things right ourselves?  And what happens when those people who we are trying to teach see us not practicing what we preach?  Security begins and ends with you.  It's time to start eating your own dogfood.

**Speaker:** Josh Sokol

### OWASP Austin Chapter Meeting, July 28th ###

**Title:** The EMV Card Standard - What is it and How Does it Work?

Europay MasterCard Visa (EMV) is a global standard by introducing a microprocessor chip into all debit and credit cards. This chip which will eventually replace the current magnetic strip on the back of credit cards as a means of mitigating credit card fraud.  All U.S. merchants will be required to support EMV by October, 2015.

This new standard has been in use in Europe and Asia for many years and has proven to be an improvement over the mag stripe.  However, there are new risks associated with the chip and the debate of the proper implementation of this new standard (e.g. the advantage over “chip-and-pin” vs. “chip-and-signature”) will continue for some time.

What is this new technology and how will it be used in transactions?  The physical and logical security characteristics of this new standard will be presented, new risks will be addressed and security recommendations will be given.

**When:** Tuesday, June 30th @ 11:45 - 1PM

**Title:** Authz is the new Authn: Trust Elevation with UMA and OpenID Connect

Increased trust in an online identity = increased mitigation of the risk of fraud. As an enterprise interacts with a person via the Internet, it may be prudent, for certain transactions, to have more evidence of that person’s identity. Web Access Management systems include some proprietary features to force “stepped-up authentication.” But luckily, new OAuth2 profiles like UMA and OpenID Connect offer a standards based approach to achieve inter-domain trust elevation. This session will include a high level overview of the Enterprise UMA use case and some of the useful OpenID Connect features that can be leveraged to create centralized authentication policies.

**Speaker:** Mike Schwartz

Mike has been an entrepreneur and identity specialist for over 18 years. He is the technical and business visionary behind Gluu, whose open source OX projects enable domains to centralize authentication and authorization using open standards like SAML and OAuth2.

### OWASP Austin March Chapter Meeting - April 28th ###

**Title:** Using OpenSAMM for Benchmarking and Software Security Improvement

We all know that behind every breach story in the press is an organization that probably should have done more to build secure software.  Yet, organizations struggle mightily to focus resources on building software securely from the outset and, as a result, software security remains an after the fact “nice to do” and not a “have to do” activity in many organizations.  How can organizations determine the right sets of activities or appropriate resource allocation levels that it should undertake to adequately address software risk? Organizations can make these determinations by benchmarking via OWASP’s Open Software Assurance Maturity Model (OpenSAMM) framework. 

A coalition of leading application security industry vendors recently contributed benchmarking data in order to enhance OpenSAMM and its assessment framework. These efforts will enable organizations to step up their software security game and identify hurdles by using OpenSAMM as a powerful benchmarking tool.  John will provide details on an ongoing industry effort to improve OpenSAMM by providing more comparative data to encourage broader use throughout industry.

### OWASP Austin February Chapter Meeting - February 24th ###
Title: Static Analysis: Beyond the Basics

Static vulnerability analysis is the practice of testing non-running software for application vulnerabilities. It is often referred to as SAST, white box testing, or automated code review. In this session we will cover some of the hows and whys of static analysis and deep dive some of the common issues users of SAST technologies often encounter. Topics will include data flow analysis and taint propagation, scan noise, and partial code scanning, specifically around OWASP Top 10 issues. The material should provide value to anyone with an interest in application security, not just static analysis practitioners.

### OWASP Austin January Chapter Meeting - January 27th ###
**Title:**  CryptoParty!!!!!!

**Abstract:**  In 1996, John Perry Barlow, co-founder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) wrote 'A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace' where he stated "We are creating a world that all may enter without privilege or prejudice accorded by race, economic power, military force, or station of birth.  We are creating a world where anyone, anywhere may express his or her beliefs, no matter how singular, without fear of being coerced into silence or conformity."  The Internet of today is an amazing place of knowledge and opportunity, but it unfortunately falls short of Mr. Barlow's original vision.

In the 21st century we face problems of climate change, energy crisis, state censorship, mass surveillance, and on-going wars.  We must be free to to communicate and associate without fear.  To realize our right to privacy and anonymity online, we need peer-reviewed, crowd-sourced solutions.  CryptoParties provide the opportunity to meet up and learn how to use these solutions to give us all the means with which to assert our right to privacy and anonymity online.  Topics include technologies like TOR, full-disk encryption, GPG, and many more.  CryptoParties are free to attend, public, and not commercially aligned.

At our January 27, 2015 OWASP Austin meeting, we will host our first ever CryptoParty with the goal of inviting others to join us in learning about the tools and technologies that enable an individual's right to privacy.  We encourage you all to invite your family, friends, and peers to attend this event.  Presentations will be laid out so that novice and experienced alike can take action based on the data presented.  All tools presented will be free and open source.  Our CryptoParty will end with the first-ever OWASP Austin Key Signing Party.  Don't miss this meeting and be sure to invite your friends!

### LASCON 2014 - October 23rd and 24th ###

The Lonestar Application Security Conference (LASCON) is an OWASP conference held annually in Austin, TX.  It started in 2010 when James Wickett (@wickett) and Josh Sokol (@joshsokol) along with the OWASP Austin crew put together an amazing 1-day conference with a speaker lineup of some of the who’s-who of the infosec and appsec world. In 2011, the conference grew to over 250 attendees and in 2012 the OWASP Austin crew hosted AppSec USA LASCON Edition–which has been heralded as the best security conferences ever by long-time infosec luminary Gene Kim.

LASCON 2014, run by David Hughes(@Dav1dHugh3s) and the OWASP Austin crew, will be run in the same tradition as previous LASCON conferences featuring the best speakers, a close-knit community atmosphere and even our signature happy hour replete with a mechanical bull. Year over year, LASCON has been a gathering of thought leaders, web developers, security engineers, mobile developers and information security professionals. LASCON 2014 will have 2 days of pre-conference training and 2 full days of conference across 4 rooms.

### OWASP Austin September Chapter Meeting - September 30th ###
**When:** September 30th, 11:30AM to 1PM 

**Title:**  Account Entrapment 

**Abstract:**  This talk covers two ways to force a victim into an attacker's account (Account Entrapment): Login Cross-Site Request Forgery and Cookie-based or Session Entrapment. This is a commonly overlooked vulnerability despite high-profile exploits including Youtube.com. Because it is often disregarded, this talk begins with an in-depth look at attack scenarios and what an attacker can actually gain. It then describes how the two attacks work and how to defend against them. Finally, though these attacks are prevalent across the internet, it will show why state agencies (with domains ending in .state.**.us) and large organizations with many subdomains face special problems when building defenses against these attacks.

**Speaker:** Ben Broussard

**About:** Ben Broussard has been involved in the Austin Appsec scene since 2008, helping to plan the first LASCON and running the OWASP study group for a time. After doing subcontracting work for a number of security shops and gaining a breadth of experience on both the threatscape and the security organizations that attempt to address it, he took a position with San Antonio based Denim Group (now with an Austin office). When not researching appsec, Ben is a hobbyist in Human Physiology, Acrobatics, Human Evolution, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, and toddler wrangling. He also runs Hot Lava Obstacle Course located on Burnet road

### OWASP Austin March Chapter Meeting - June 24th ###
**When:** June 24th, 11:30AM to 1PM 

**Title:** Integrating process and architecture to yield robust systems

**Abstract:** When producing software products that meet the objectives of both the business unit and the security shop, the developers best friend is process and a secure architecture.  Robust systems require a holistic view of security where attribution, reliability and confidentiality do not put a strain on the dev shop, but provide an environment that optimizes the use of infrastructure and standards to yield secure and robust systems. How do we do that and meet the budget and time constraints that we all face?

### OWASP Austin February Chapter Meeting - February 25th ###

**Title:** Magical Code Injection Rainbow

**Abstract:** There are many intentionally vulnerable web applications available for people to learn how to exploit various types of flaws. Unfortunately, many of them have only the most basic and easily exploited examples of flaws. In order to work with a more complex version of a flaw, it's usually necessary to write your own vulnerable application or modify an existing one.
There is another option! The Magical Code Injection Rainbow! MCIR is a framework for building configurable vulnerable applications. This presentation will demonstrate the use of the existing MCIR applications such as SQLol (for SQL injection) and XMLmao (for XML and XPath injection), teach advanced exploitation techniques in SQL injection; XPath injection; cross-site scripting; and shell command injection, discuss the exploitation of insecure cryptosystems and discuss how to use the MCIR framework to build your own configurable vulnerable application.

**Speaker:**  Daniel Crowley(aka "unicornFurnace") is a Senior Security Consultant for Trustwave's SpiderLabs team. Daniel denies all allegations regarding unicorn smuggling and questions your character for even suggesting it. Daniel has developed configurable testbeds such as SQLol and XMLmao for training and research regarding specific vulnerabilities. Daniel enjoys climbing large rocks. Daniel has been working in the information security industry since 2004 and is a frequent speaker at conferences including Black Hat, DEF CON, Shmoocon, and SOURCE. Daniel does his own charcuterie.

**Topic: ** Anatomy of Advanced Email Attacks (Aaron Estes, Cigital)

Abstract:  Email attacks comprise an overwhelming majority of the daily attacks on modern enterprise.  The leading mitigation strategy is a combination of user awareness training and email filtering.  This talk outlines a proposed solution that brings email risk and awareness information down to the client level in order to better equip end users in making secure decisions when using email.

Anti-spam capabilities have been incorporated into email client applications for some time now.  These are usually in the form of junk boxes or email filters that attempt to identify spam or other unwanted email.  Most anti-spam clients use bayesian filtering to determine whether an email is spam or not spam, typically using word combinations and statistical analysis to make a determination.  Many experts also advise wary email users to examine the raw email headers in order to attempt to find evidence of an email attack.  While this is not bad advise, it is however a highly technical process and one cannot expect the majority of email users to be able to carry out and act upon this advice.  This is the problem that the proposed Advanced Email Risk Classification and Recipient Decision Assistance solution attempts to solve.  The operating name for this solution is Phish Finder.

**Who: ** Aaron Estes, Cigital

**Topic: Half-Day Threat Modeling Seminar with John Steven of Cigital**

How will attackers break your web application? How much security testing is enough? Do I have to worry about insiders? Threat modeling, applied with a risk management approach can answer both of these questions if done correctly. This talk will present advanced threat modeling step-wise through examples and exercises using the Java EE platform and focusing on authentication, authorization, and session management.

Participants will learn, through interactive exercise on real software architectures, how to use diagramming techniques to explicitly document threats their applications face, identify how assets worth protecting manifest themselves within the system, and enumerate the attack vectors these threats take advantage of. Participants will then engage in secure design activities, learning how to use the threat model to specify compensating controls for specified attack vectors. Finally, we'll discuss how the model can drive security testing and validate an application resists specified attack.

**Who:** John Steven(Cigital)

John Steven is the Senior Director, Advanced Technology Consulting at Cigital with over a decade of hands-on experience in software security. John's expertise runs the gamut of software security from threat modeling and architectural risk analysis, through static analysis (with an emphasis on automation), to security testing.

**Topic: ** STAAF: A FLOSS Framework for Scalable and Sharable Android App Analysis

With no end of Android malware anywhere in sight, it’s no wonder that so many Android analysis tools have been released lately.  While each of these powerful tools makes great strides in finding artifacts in an individual application, they’re typically not designed to scale beyond a few thousand selected samples at most.  In order to effective insight into android applications researchers need to be be able to analyze a substantial subset of the 300k+ applications in the official store, all of the applications across the disparate unofficial Android stores and repositories, as well as ad-hoc manually-submitted applications.  This was the motivation for STAAF, a Scalable Tailored Application Analysis Framework.  STAAF was designed to allow an analyst to easily add/remove/configure various analysis modules, then process large numbers of applications at once or over time, then share the raw data, processed data, and results with other organizations.  In this presentation I’ll cover the STAAF Architecture, the current status and available implementation, and if circumstances permit, show a quick demo with a handful of applications.

**Who:** Ryan Smith (Praetorian)

**Topic: ** Protecting Your Applications from Backdoors: How to Secure Your Business Critical Applications from Time Bombs, Backdoors & Data Exfiltration

With the increasing practice of outsourcing and using 3rd party libraries, it is nearly impossible for an enterprise to identify the pedigree and security of the software running its business critical applications. As a result backdoors and malicious code are increasingly becoming the prevalent attack vector used by hackers. Whether you manage internal development activities, work with third party developers or are developing a COTS application for enterprise, your mandate is clear- safeguard your code and make applications security a priority for internal and external development teams. 

In this session we will cover:

* Prevalence of backdoors and malicious code in third party attacks 

* Definitions and classifications of backdoors and their impact on your applications 

* Methods to identify, track and remediate these vulnerabilities 

**Who:** Joe Brady (Veracode)

**Topic: ** Rugged Dev: Building Reliability and Security Into Software

Complex systems fail over time and the larger they are, the more likely they are to fail in unforeseen ways. Come hear about the best practices we used and lessons learned when we built very large scale cloud-based products. Once exposed to the Internet, complex multi-tenant Web systems encounter a wide range of input from a variety of sources but still have to be long running and behave resiliently in the face of failures. We will examine 3 implementations of Rugged best practices to design and test your software for ruggedness.

**Topic: ** Supercharged Password Cracking Techniques

In the past 2-3 years there have been many important discoveries/releases in
the world of password cracking. Between massive password leaks (like RockYou,
Gawker, etc) and the release of many free tools that take advantage of 
the processing power of GPU cards, there are many new techniques/tools/tricks
that security professionals should be taking advantage of while cracking 
passwords. But, by default tools you download (Like John the Ripper) do not
take advantage of this.

Over the past 12 years, Rick has been collecting password hashes from various
large corporations (during authorized penetration tests). For years now, he 
has been cracking these passwords, and discovering more and more patterns that
users are using. But the majority of password cracking tools out there
(Such as John the Ripper, L0phtCrack, etc) do not take advantage of these 
"human weaknesses" in password creation. So far Rick has cracked almost 4 
million hashes from inside corporate America, and an additional 5+ million 
from sources over the Internet.

During this talk Rick will talk about the current state of password cracking
by walking the attendees through a PWDUMP output file containing 49000+ 
real "complex" NTLM passwords) how the default rule-set provided by John 
the Ripper can be improved to crack tens of thousands of additional passwords. 
Wordlists/Dictionaries will be shared that can help you better crack 
passwords (these wordlists were created based on what users are _actually_ 
doing in Fortune 500 environments). New "rules" will be given out that were 
created to specifically attack the patterns that users are choosing.

This is relevant to OWASP, because the applications we are developing/securing
almost always have logins and passwords that protect them. But, unlike Operating
Systems, our web applications do not usually have strict password requirements
that users have to meet in order to create an account. We do this as to not
scare away users; but we are placing our OWN systems at risk. 

Even now, sites like Google/Twitter/Facebook only warn the users about poor
passwords, or have a list of 500 passwords that are not allowed. This will
_not_ be the case in 10 years.  Lets address this problem now.

The only way to address the problem, is to first become aware of how bad
our users are at choosing passwords , and what we can do (as developers or
security professionals) to help protect our users from themselves.

**Topic: ** Smart Phones with Dumb Apps

Enterprises are targeting both internal users and customers with smartphone applications for platforms such as Apple iPhone and Google Android. Many of these applications are constructed without fully considering the associated security implications of their deployment. Breaches can impact both users as well as the enterprise distributing the application as attackers take advantage of expanded access to sensitive data and network services. This talk discusses emerging threats associated with deploying smartphone applications and provides an overview of the threat modeling process. The presentation then walks example applications from an attacker’s perspective demonstrating the sort of information they are able to extract allowing for more advanced attacks.

**Topic: ** Application Assessments Reloaded

Trying to integrate Business Software Assurance into Enterprise Risk Management and Information Security Management programs has had issues over the years. Penetration-testing was announced dead over a year ago, but it's still the number one choice of application security professionals when starting out. Can the activities from penetration-testing be re-used and turned into something innovative?

Tools (especially application scanners and secure static analysis tools) have error rates so high, they are useless in the hands of newcomers (even for peripheral security testing). Some organizations have built entire applications around or on top of existing appsec tools. Others are looking to use other kinds of tools, such as process/methodology/workflow tools, to enhance their classic penetration-testing tools.

Even the testing/inspection methodologies themselves are outdated and we're finding that they are challenging or repetitive in many environments. How do current appsec tools and testing/inspection methods work in the cloud? If we re-run the same kinds of tests during dev-test, software quality, and application security cycles, aren't we wasting valuable time and effort?

This presentation will provide discussion around how to solve many of these and other challenges in application security. The focus will be on web applications that use common technologies (HTTP, SQL, Classic XML/HTML, Javascript, Flash) but also updated to today's standards (RESTful transactions, NoSQL, HTML5, Ajax/Json, Flex2).

Everyone wants to stretch their security budget, and automated application security tools are an appealing choice for doing so. However, manual security testing isn’t going anywhere until the HAL application scanner comes online. This presentation will use often humorous, real-world examples to illustrate the relative strengths and weaknesses of automated solutions and manual techniques. 

<br> Automated tools have some strengths, namely low incremental cost, detecting simple vulnerabilities, and performing highly repetitive tasks. However, automated solutions are far from perfect. There are entire classes of vulnerabilities that are theoretically impossible for automated software to detect. Examples include complex information leakage, race conditions, logic flaws, design flaws, and multistage process attacks. Beyond that, there are many vulnerabilities that are too complicated or obscure to practically detect with an automated tool.

**Topic: ** Reducing Your Data Security Risk Through Tokenization 

The first Austin OWASP meeting of the year is on a really interesting topic that many of you have probably never thought about: Tokenization. The concept is simple...use tokens to represent your data instead of passing around the data itself. For example, why would you give a customer account representative a full credit card number when all they need to do their job is the last four digits? Using tokenization, we are able to reduce the data security risk by limiting the number of systems that actually store the data. This extremely simplifies audits for regulations like SOX, HIPAA, and PCI DSS. This presentation will cover the business drivers for data protection, what tokenization is, and how to implement it. If your organization has data to protect, then you're going to want to check out this presentation.

**Topic: ** Tracking the progress of an SDL program: lessons from the gym 

Forcing muscle growth is a long process which requires high intensity weight training and high mental concentration. While the ultimate goal is often clear, one of the greatest mistakes bodybuilders consistently make is to overlook the importance of tracking their weight lifting progress. 

Like a successful bodybuilding workout, a security development lifecycle program must consistently log simple to obtain, yet meaningful metrics throughout the entire process. Good metrics must lack subjectivity and clearly aid decision makers to determine areas that need improvement. In this presentation we’ll discuss metrics used to classify and appropriately compare security vulnerabilities found in different phases of the SDL by different teams working in different locations and in different products. We’ll also discuss how to easily provide decision makers different views of the same data and verify whether the process is indeed catching critical vulnerabilities internally.

**Topic: ** Vulnerability Management In An Application Security World 

Identifying application-level vulnerabilities via penetration tests and code reviews is only the first step in actually addressing the underlying risk. Managing vulnerabilities for applications is more challenging than dealing with traditional infrastructure-level vulnerabilities because they typically require the coordination of security teams with application development teams and require security managers to secure time from developers during already-cramped development and release schedules. In addition, fixes require changes to custom application code and application-specific business logic rather than the patches and configuration changes that are often sufficient to address infrastructure-level vulnerabilities. 

This presentation details many of the pitfalls organizations encounter while trying to manage application-level vulnerabilities as well as outlines strategies security teams can use for communicating with development teams. Similarities and differences between security teams’ practice of vulnerability management and development teams’ practice of defect management will be addressed in order to facilitate healthy communication between these groups.

**Topic: ** Architecting Secure Web Systems 

For this month's presentation, we diverge from the typical OWASP topics of writing secure code, testing to make sure your code is secure, and other code related topics and delve into the process of actually architecting a secure web application from the ground up. We'll start with some basic n-tier architecture (web vs app vs DB), throw in some firewall and DMZ concepts, then talk about server hardening with client firewalls (iptables), disabling services, and other techniques. Whether you're a code monkey wondering how the rest of the world works, a security guy trying to figure out what you're missing, or an auditor just trying to understand how the pieces fit together, this presentation is for you.

**Topic: ** Web Application Security in the Airline Industry: Stealing the Airlines’ Online Data 

In this session, attendees will learn about the types of airline data that is at risk of being stolen by online data thieves. In addition, the following topics will be further explored: 

1. Important attack scenarios and Web-based vulnerabilities accompanied by examples of how these attacks can be mitigated by deploying comprehensive defense solutions; 

2. Protection strategies and tools, such as Web application scanners and Web application firewalls, which help equalize the gap between the advanced Web hacker and the security professional; and 

3. Compliance and Software development life cycle approaches. 

Following the September 11 attacks, the airline industry recognized its need to ‘webify’ online ticket reservation systems, crew scheduling, and passenger profiles in order to enhance operational efficiency. This ultimately served to decrease the airlines’ operating costs, thereby increasing their operating profits. However, the following questions remain: At what costs? What are the information systems and customer data security risks associated with the airline ‘webification’ process? 

Please join in this presentation, which will outline some of the challenges that members of the airlines industry may face when attempting to protect their online services. Additionally, attendees will discover methodologies that airlines may utilize to identify, assess, and protect against the various risks associated with Web-based application attacks.

<br> **Topic: ** Securely Handling Sensitive Configuration Data. 

One of the age old problems with web applications was keeping sensitive data available on a need to know basis. The classic case of this is database credentials. The application needs them to connect to the database but developers shouldn't have direct access to the DB - particularly the production DB. The presentation will discuss how we took on this specific problem, our determination that this was a specific case of a more general problem and how we solved that general problem. In our solution, sensitive data is only available to the application and trusted 3rd parties (e.g. DBAs). We will then cover our implementation of that solution in a .Net 2.0 environment and discuss some options for J2EE environments. So far, we used our .Net solution successfully for database credentials and private encryption keys used in XML-DSig. Sensitive data is only available to the application and trusted 3rd parties (e.g. DBAs).

**Topic: **Web Services Security The concept of web services has become ubiquitous over the last few years. Frameworks are now available across many platforms and languages to greatly ease and expedite the development of web services, often with a vast amount of existing code reuse. Software companies are taking advantage of this by integrating this technology into their products giving increased power and interoperability to their customers. However, the power web services enables also introduces new risks to an environment. As with web applications, development has outpaced the understanding and mitigation of vulnerabilities that arise from this emerging technology. This presentation will first aim to identify the risks associated with web services. We will describe the existing security standards and technologies which target web services (i.e., WS-Security) including its history, pros and cons, and current status. Finally we will attempt to extrapolate the future of this space to determine what changes must be made going forward.

**What:** Security – The Road Less Travelled 

Abstract - What do you think Shakespeare had to say about Software Security? What does an naked motorist have to do with Confidentiality? What does the Jungle Book character Baloo have to say about Security Essentials (The Bear Bare Necessities of Life security)? What does the African Wildlife have to do with Security Concepts? What does pH have to do with Security? and more … The Road Less Travelled by renowed poet, Robert Frost ends by with the statement “And that has made all the difference”. Come to find out the answers to the questions above and see what it takes to look at Security from a different perspective, that would make ALL the difference. The session will cover not only the higher level abstractions of security concepts, but will dive deep wherever applicable into concepts and code, making it a MUST attend for Development, QA, PM and Management Staff on both the IT and Business side.

**Who:** Jeremiah Grossman (WhiteHat Security, CTO, OWASP Founder, Security Blogger) 

**Topic: Business Logic Flaws** 

Session handling, credit card transactions, and password recovery are just a few examples of Web-enabled business logic processes that malicious hackers have abused to compromise major websites. These types of vulnerabilities are routinely overlooked during QA because the process is intended to test what a piece of code is supposed to do and not what it can be made to do. The other problem(s) with business logic flaws is scanners can’t identify them, IDS can’t detect them, and Web application firewalls can’t defend them. Plus, the more sophisticated and Web 2.0 feature-rich a website, the more prone it is to have flaws in business logic. 

This presentation will provide real-world demonstrations of how pernicious and dangerous business logic flaws are to the security of a website. He’ll also show how best to spot them and provide organizations with a simple and rational game plan to prevent them.
