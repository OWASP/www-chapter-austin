 ### OWASP Austin Chapter Meeting, September 24, 2019   ###

**When:** Tuesday, September 24th @ 11:45 AM - 1:00 PM

**Where:** National Instruments, 11500 N. Mopac.Building C

**Title:** OAuth 2.0 Misimplementation, Vulnerabilities and Best Practices

<blockquote>OAuth 2.0 is an authorization framework that enables third party applications to obtain temporary limited authorization to access a protected resource on behalf of a resource owner. The framework is defined by authorization interactions that are each scoped to the type of client obtaining authorization and the type or types of resource owners that must grant access. Diverging from these defined scopes can open up various interception and redirect attack vectors that can grant a malicious actor access to protected resources. For this talk, we will be discussing Public Clients vs Confidential Clients, User Authentication vs Client Authentication, Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) for Public Clients, and how restricting certain OAuth flows to either Public or Confidential Clients is required to mitigate unauthorized access to protected resources.</blockquote>

**Speaker:** Pak Foley

<blockquote>Pak Foley is a Security Engineer at Procore Technologies. He has specialized in Identity and Access Management with a focus on architecting enterprise OAuth and SAML solutions for authentication and authorization throughout distributed systems. With a passion for OAuth in particular, he has spent much of his time seeking out and mitigating vulnerabilities from misimplemented OAuth solutions and contributed to the open source Rails OAuth provider, Doorkeeper. His passion for securing web applications has prompted his recent move from IAM to security.</blockquote>

**When:** Tuesday, August 27th @ 11:45 AM - 1:00 PM

**Where:** Norris Conference Center, 2525 W. Anderson Lane, Suite 365, Austin TX 78757

**Title:** A Standards-Based Approach to Assessing Your Organization's Cybersecurity Maturity

<blockquote>We were tasked with creating a roadmap for the National Instruments Information Security Program. While we had previously used a Gartner Maturity Model to figure out how far along our organization was, we found their recommendations to be too high level to define an actionable roadmap. After some discussion, we determined that we could use the NIST Cybersecurity Framework to not only assess our maturity, but also define risk in our environment, and create a roadmap. This talk will not only show you how we did it, but how you can do it too!</blockquote>

**Speaker:** Josh Sokol and Alex Polimeni

<blockquote>Josh Sokol, CISSP, graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with a BS in Computer Science in 2002.

Anecdoctally: I've witnessed security organizations ignored, however praised by leadership for their work. Thus, does the security operation exist? Or is too much of a cost center? How can leaders utilize their security assets for organizational and personnel growth? How can the security worker look towards a better work/life balance? </blockquote>

This talk aims to introduce application security professionals to the basics of AngularJS and Angular applications from a security standpoint. We will also demonstrate how to dynamically debug Angular code from the browser console. This allows us to change the behavior on an application by manipulating Angular components.
