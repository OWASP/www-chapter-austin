## Sponsorship Opportunities with our Chapter ##

The Austin OWASP Chapter can offer your company several sponsorship opportunities. If you are interested in taking advantage of any of these opportunities, please contact Tiana Chandler (tiana[dot]chandler[at]owasp.org), the OWASP Austin Chapter Sponsor Coordinator. 

### Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour Sponsorship ### 

The Austin OWASP Chapter coordinates a monthly Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour during the months of January through September. To make it a fun and unique event, we ask the sponsor to cover the cost of drinks and appetizers (usually between $500 and $750, depending upon attendance). In addition to the networking opportunities, we offer promotion via our Austin OWASP website page, announcement at chapter meetings, and email notification to mailing lists. The Happy Hour allows sponsors the chance to chat informally with the attendees, which allows for networking and also discussion regarding your company’s products or services.  In addition, you can use this opportunity as a forum to distribute product literature, logo items, or any other token items that would help folks remember your brand.

Interested in Sponsoring? We are currently seeking happy hour sponsors for our monthly event. Please contact <a href="mailto:tiana.chandler@owasp.org?subject=OWASP Happy Hour Sponsor">Tiana Chandler</a> if you are interested.

### Lonestar Application Security Conference (LASCON) Sponsorship ### 

The Lonestar Application Security Conference (LASCON) is held annually in Austin, TX. It is a gathering of web app developers, security engineers, mobile developers and information security professionals. LASCON is held in Texas where more Fortune 500 companies call home than any other state and it is held in Austin which is a hub for startups in the state of Texas. At LASCON, leaders at these companies along with security architects and developers gather to share cutting-edge ideas, initiatives, and technology advancements.

Being a non-profit organization, we rely mostly on sponsorships to help us provide the funding to make LASCON successful.

**Other opportunities not currently needed, but may seek on occasion**

### OWASP Meeting Lunch Sponsorship ### 

Our monthly Austin OWASP meetings are held during a person's typical lunch hours from 11:30 AM to 1:00 PM. For your sponsorship of around $750 we can arrange food and drinks for up to 60 attendees. In exchange for your sponsorship, our chapter will provide you with 5 minutes at the start of the meeting to introduce yourself and tell us about the products or services that your company offers. You'll also receive mention of being the lunch sponsor in all e-mail communications about the meeting. 

### OWASP Meeting Presenter Sponsorship ### 

Although OWASP is a non-profit organization, we strive to provide our members with the best presenters we possibly can. While the Austin area has tons of security talent, sometimes it's worthwhile to reach beyond our borders to pull in more awesome presenters. In exchange for covering travel expenses for these presenters, our chapter will provide you with 5 minutes at the start of the meeting to introduce yourself and tell us about the products or services that your company offers. You'll also receive mention of being the presenter sponsor in all e-mail communications about the meeting.
