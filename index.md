**Title: Incident Response is haaaaard, But it doesn’t have to be – PREPARE NOW** 
<blockquote> 
  <br>
    So your EDR, AV, or other fancy shiny blinky lights security tools alerted you that a system has some suspicious activity.  Do you have the details you need to investigate or remediate the system?  Can you quickly and easily investigate it?   You can enable a lot of things you already have for FREE to help you with your investigations, no matter the tools used.  Let’s take a look how we do Incident Response on a system and what you can do to prepare for an inevitable event.
    <br><br>
    How is your logging?  Is it enabled?  Configured to some best practice? (hopefully better than an industry standard that is seriously lacking).  Have you enabled some critical logs that by default are NOT enable?  Do you have a way to run a command, script, or a favorite tool across one or all your systems and retrieve the results?  Do you block some well-known exploitable things?  How do you know?
    <br><br>
    Everything mentioned here is FREE and you already have it!
    <br><br>
    This talk will describe these things and how to prepare, and be PREPARED to do incident Response, yes, even for DevOps.  A few tools will be discussed as well that you can use to speed things up.
    <br><br>
    The attendee can take the information from this talk and immediately start improving their environment to prepare for the inevitable, an incident.
