### OWASP Austin Chapter Meeting February 22nd 2022 ###

**When:** Tuesday, February 22, 2022 @ 12:00 AM - 1:00 PM

**Title: Security Observability 101: Thinking Inside the Box!** 
<blockquote> 
Software is incredibly hard to secure because it's a black box. We've spent decades struggling to verify properties of software from the outside by analyzing the source code, scanning, fuzzing, pentesting, etc... The goal of "security observability" is to expose exactly what's going on inside the box while it's running. Analyzing a running application has speed, accuracy, coverage, and scalability advantages that change the way Dev, Sec, and Ops communicate and work together. In this talk, you'll learn how to use the free and open source Java Observability Toolkit (JOT) project to easily create your own powerful "inside out" security tests without coding. You can use JOT to analyze security defenses, identify complex vulnerabilities, create custom sandboxes, and enforce policy at runtime. Ultimately, security observability enables DevSecOps to work together in harmony, so you can focus on delivering value at high velocity.
