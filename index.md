**Title: Secure Application Development (with Cloud)** 
<blockquote> 
<br>
Most of us have developed software in one form or the other over our careers. Have we paid attention to all domains of the software lifecycle? This is a walkthrough of those domains that should span development from cradle to grave of any software development lifecycle, with a focus on security. We will follow that by a quick demo of how CI/CD and DevSecOps practices can help us address these concerns for deployment to cloud providers like AWS and Azure in a hybrid cloud environment.

Target audience: Developers, Architects, Security, Ops, and Software Managers.
PreRequisite: Some level of understanding of Software Development Lifecycle, with passion to make your code safer and better.
