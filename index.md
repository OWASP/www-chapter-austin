### Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour sponsored by Pure Storage, January 9, 2020 ###

**When:** Thursday, January 9th, 5:30 pm - 7:30 pm

**Where:** Brass Tap @ Domain Austin, 10910 Domain Dr, Austin, TX 78758 (across from the iPic Theaters). We meet in the separate room inside the bar, to the left as you enter. Parking: Park in either parking garages to the left or right of iPic (<a href="https://www.simon.com/mall/the-domain/map/#/location/the-brass-tap" target="_blank">map of Domain</a>).

**What:** The Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour is a monthly event coordinated by the Austin OWASP and Capital of Texas ISSA Chapters and sponsored by various companies. We try to meet every second Thursday of the month from January to September (but occasionally we make schedule adjustments when needed). The event is an informal social gathering of local information security professionals. If you're involved with InfoSec or even if you have an interest, come on out for drinks, good food and conversation. 

**Speaker:** Pure Storage

<blockquote>Here at Pure Storage, we know security isn’t a single-point solution that you buy and implement – it’s an ongoing effort that comprises people, processes, policies and technologies that work together to secure the enterprise. We help make that easier for you by integrating two fundamental features into our systems. First, we secure data at rest with Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 140-2-certified Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 256. The management of these encryption keys is completely self-contained and requires no external manipulation. Even more importantly, the encryption process is in-line with the data processing, and has no impact to performance. Second, we monitor access and functions based on specific account privileges (RBAC), restrict external connections to the system and require complex passwords. All of this has been certified using the most stringent government guidelines, and resulted in our National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP) Common Criteria Certification.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In addition to our built-in software-based security features, we also offer a hardware-based security mechanism, our Rapid Data Lock (RDL) and At-Rest Encryption capabilities. This accessory makes it possible to instantly disable an array and crypto-lock the data, greatly reducing risk of loss, capture or compromise, as well as potentially simplifying logistics of shipment and deployment.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Pure Storage identifies and addresses critical cyber security gaps and makes specific recommendations to address them – quickly and efficiently.</blockquote>

<strong>Pure Storage will have a drawing for a $100 gift card ... must be present to win.

**Title:** OWASP Austin CryptoParty!

<blockquote>
        In 1996, John Perry Barlow, co-founder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) wrote 'A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace' where he stated "We are creating a world that all may enter without privelege or prejudice accorded by race, economic power, military force, or station of birth. We are creating a world where anyone, anywhere may express his or her beliefs, no matter how singular, without fear of being coerced into silence or conformity." The Internet of today is an amazing place of knowledge and opportunity, but it unfortunately falls short of Mr. Barlow's original vision.
        <br/>
        In the 21st century we face problems of climate change, energy crisis, state censorship, mass surveillance, and on-going wars. We must be free to to communicate and associate without fear. To realize our right to privacy and anonymity online, we need peer-reviewed, crowd-sourced solutions. CryptoParties provide the opportunity to meet up and learn how to use these solutions to give us all the means with which to assert our right to privacy and anonymity online. Topics include technologies like TOR, full-disk encryption, GPG, and many more. CryptoParties are free to attend, public, and not commercially aligned.
        <br/>
        The Austin Chapter of the OWASP Foundation invites you to join us for our CryptoParty where you will learn the tools and techniques to keep you safe from prying eyes.
        <br/>
