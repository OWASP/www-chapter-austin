### OWASP Austin Chapter Meeting July 2022 ###

**When:** Tuesday, July 26th, 2022 @ 11:30 AM - 1:00 PM

**Presentation: 10lbs of tacos in a 5lb bag: Lessons Learned from Security Operations in a Dynamic and Resource Constrained Environment** 
<blockquote> 
Building security processes and teams is never easy but can be especially challenging in an evolving, fast-paced environment.  In this presentation, one of the nation’s leading experts in herding cats will share their experience building a security presence, essentially, from the ground up at a company in the middle of its own transformation.  Then, they will discuss some of the lessons learned and other takeaways in hopes that it might aid some of you in your journey.
</blockquote>
