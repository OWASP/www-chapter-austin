### OWASP Austin Chapter Meeting February 2024 ###

**When:** Tuesday, February 27, 2024 @ 11:45 AM - 1:00 PM

**Presentation: API Security flaws that are commonly exploited.**
<blockquote> 
As more and more development focusses on APIs to make things faster and easier, security needs to be pushed more toward the front. Mistakes that have been corrected in web application security have now returned as APIs aren’t offered the same protections as they are usually out of the normal flow via security tooling such as WAFs. This means identifying and fixing flaws prior to production is important. This discussion will be around lessons learned from testing and breach data with an eye for prevention. This attendees will learn:
Application and API stacks are full of dangerous over-powered methods. These lurking menaces are built into libraries, frameworks, appservers, and runtime platforms. They do crazy things (from a security perspective) like start native processes, parse XML documents, evaluate expressions, and deserialize objects. And they are totally unprotected. Developers can use them without restriction, and attackers can target these binary Bambis without being detected or stopped. Unfortunately, the security of the entire digital ecosystem is entirely reliant on getting developers to take the right steps to use these methods safely… but it’s way too hard.
</blockquote>
