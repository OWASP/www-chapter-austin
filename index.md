**Presentation: Building the Next Generation in AppSec**

Today's challenges cannot be solved with yesterday's methods. There is a great need for a new generation of skilled appsec professionals, but there are few entry-level jobs and places to learn. That needs to change. This session will talk about work Robert has done with several different universities (University of Southern California, University of Arizona, Arizona State University, and Grand Canyon University) to help bring application security awareness to students in a variety of fashions and some of the ways this helps them find work after graduation. Particular attention will be given to work as part of the CHOPS (CyberSecurity Hands On Problem Solving) certification program at Arizona State, and to work done with USC related to their MBV program

**Presentation: PRESENTATION-NAME**

The Secure Development Lifecycle (SDL) is a powerful construct that can advance security for both organizations with established security practices by shifting left, and immature organizations seeking a framework to implement security best practices in agile development. NI has been on a journey over the last several years to improve the security of its products driven by customer requirements, their expectations, and increasingly, regulations that require software to be developed with secure methodologies. Security is as much about a mindset and development culture as it is about tools, vulnerabilities, and security technologies. Learn how NIâ€™s adoption of the Secure Development Lifecycle has created a framework for addressing various security challenges in web applications, microservices, and infrastructure.
