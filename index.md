**Title:The Spice Must Flow: AppSec for DevOps** 
<blockquote> 
  <br>
Your approach to application security will likely be dictated by your team’s role in the development process.  Developers will usually gravitate to SAST and security engineers to DAST but what about everyone in between?  Should DevOps try to adopt these strategies, modify them, or reinvent the wheel?
<br>
In this session, we’ll discuss several different approaches that you can take when rolling out your application security strategy that keep DevOps top of mind.

### LASCON 2020 ###

From the LASCON 2020 Planning Team:

It is with heavy heart that we are cancelling LASCON for 2020.

The highlight of LASCON has always been the community of people that meet for learning and sharing for the days of the conference.  Due to the uncertainty related to the coronavirus pandemic, the planning team has made the difficult decision to cancel LASCON for 2020 in its entirety.  While we did consider going virtual with the conference, we determined we could not provide the community atmosphere that makes LASCON special. We are now winding down LASCON for 2020 and looking ahead to LASCON in 2021.

All advance ticket purchases will be refunded in full, and funds will be credited back via the original method of purchase.  Sponsors will be contacted directly with additional details.

For those who have submitted their talks and training as part of our CFP and CFT, we want to express our appreciation of your willingness to contribute to LASCON 2020 and help to make it a successful event. While we will not have an event this year, we wish that you consider submitting your talk or training as part of our CFP and CFT for LASCON 2021 when we make those available.

Any questions should be directed to lascon@owasp.org

We thank you for all the support we receive from the community, and we look forward to hosting you once again for an awesome LASCON in 2021
