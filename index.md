### OWASP Austin Chapter Meeting May 2023 ###

**When:** Tuesday, May 30th, 2023 @ 11:30 AM - 1:00 PM

**Presentation: How Zero Trust can improve your web application security** 
<blockquote> 
In this presentation, we will review some of the Zero Trust concepts and roadmapping some adoption schemes.  We will dive into some examples of using these concepts to improve and provide better controls around:

* Setup and configuration of Zero Trust Services
* Developer access and code security gains
* Exposing internal web sites securely with MFA (even if not designed with MFA) with user and group driven policies without a VPN
* Gain a WAF with exposing internal web sites through browser-based Zero Trust Network Access.
* Dealing with 3rd party access to internal web sites
</blockquote>

**Speaker:** 
<blockquote>
Mark Spears

Currently, Mark is a Principal Security Consultant at Solis Security and having fulfilled significant time as a network defender and vCISO dealing with writing and testing InfoSec Programs and dealing with auditors and endless reporting, he also started the OffSec program at Solis Security. Red Pill or Blue Pill.A lot of his most recent education and skill focus has been on helping companies with their Web Application security through Secure-SDLC practices including configuration of Web Application Firewalls and Zero Trust solutions. If not enjoying his work at Solis Security, he can be found practicing physical security, lock picking, social engineering, or hardware hacking.
Otherwise, he is on a Harley Davidson feeding his inner rebel!
