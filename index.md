### OWASP Austin Chapter Meeting August 2022 ###

**When:** Tuesday, August 30th, 2022 @ 11:30 AM - 1:00 PM

**Presentation: API Security: When Failure looks like Success w/ Keith Casey** 
<blockquote> 
In the last decade, APIs have become fundamental to our teams, partners, and customers. While we’d like to believe it all happened as a carefully executed plan, let’s be honest: There's as much luck as foresight in the mix. Luckily, success drives success so we’ve seen things explode in great ways. Unfortunately, that very success has cost us too.
<br>
APIs are becoming a consistent and devastating attack vector for applications that store everything from financial records to passport information to what you’re looking for in a date. In this session, we’ll reconsider some of our earliest assumptions and lay out some strategies for bringing our APIs out of the shadows and protecting ourselves, our partners, and our customers.
</blockquote>
