### Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour sponsored by Rapid7, March 12, 2020 ###

**When:** Thursday, March 12th, 5:30 pm - 7:30 pm

**Where:** Brass Tap @ Domain Austin, 10910 Domain Dr, Austin, TX 78758 (across from the iPic Theaters). We meet in the separate room inside the bar, to the left as you enter. Parking: Park in either parking garages to the left or right of iPic (<a href="https://www.simon.com/mall/the-domain/map/#/location/the-brass-tap" target="_blank">map of Domain</a>).

**What:** The Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour is a monthly event coordinated by the Austin OWASP and Capital of Texas ISSA Chapters and sponsored by various companies. We try to meet every second Thursday of the month from January to September (but occasionally we make schedule adjustments when needed). The event is an informal social gathering of local information security professionals. If you're involved with InfoSec or even if you have an interest, come on out for drinks, good food and conversation.

**Title: Secure Application Development (with Cloud)** 
<blockquote> 
<br>
Most of us have developed software in one form or the other over our careers. Have we paid attention to all domains of the software lifecycle? This is a walkthrough of those domains that should span development from cradle to grave of any software development lifecycle, with a focus on security. We will follow that by a quick demo of how CI/CD and DevSecOps practices can help us address these concerns for deployment to cloud providers like AWS and Azure in a hybrid cloud environment.

Target audience: Developers, Architects, Security, Ops, and Software Managers.
PreRequisite: Some level of understanding of Software Development Lifecycle, with passion to make your code safer and better.
