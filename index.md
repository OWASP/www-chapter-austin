### OWASP Austin Chapter Meeting April 26th 2022 ###

**When:** Tuesday, April 26th, 2022 @ 11:30 AM - 1:00 PM

**Title:Securing the Edge** 
<blockquote> 
We are moving to a new era of compute that is more democratized than ever, underpinned by 5G networks, and focused on “things enabled” experiences. We are moving closer to the edge!
Edge can bring network and security closer together. Compared with legacy security controls, edge security controls need to provide broader, more centralized visibility across the entire attack surface.
</blockquote>

**Speaker:** 
<blockquote>
Join Theresa Lanowitz, Head of Cybersecurity Evangelism, AT&T Business as she reveals the findings of the most recent AT&T Cybersecurity Insights Report and discusses common architectures, use cases, and the perceived risk associated with edge deployments.
