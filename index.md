**Presentation: PRESENTATION-NAME**

The Secure Development Lifecycle (SDL) is a powerful construct that can advance security for both organizations with established security practices by shifting left, and immature organizations seeking a framework to implement security best practices in agile development. NI has been on a journey over the last several years to improve the security of its products driven by customer requirements, their expectations, and increasingly, regulations that require software to be developed with secure methodologies. Security is as much about a mindset and development culture as it is about tools, vulnerabilities, and security technologies. Learn how NI’s adoption of the Secure Development Lifecycle has created a framework for addressing various security challenges in web applications, microservices, and infrastructure.

### Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour, TBD, 2026 ###

**When:** Thursday, TBD, 5:30 pm - 7:30 pm

**Where:** Lavaca Street Bar at the Domain Northside (Rock Rose District), 11420 Rock Rose Ave #100, Austin, TX 78758.

**What:** The Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour is a monthly event coordinated by the Austin OWASP Chapter and sponsored by various companies. We try to meet every second Thursday of the month from January to September (but occasionally we make schedule adjustments when needed). The event is an informal social gathering of local information security professionals. If you're involved with InfoSec or even if you have an interest, come on out for drinks, good food and conversation.

<blockquote>
Unfortunately we were not able to obtain a sponsor for this month’s Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour. With that, the September happy hour that was scheduled for this Thursday at the Lavaca Street Bar has been cancelled.
As a reminder, this was to be our last one for the year. We do not have our happy hour in October, November, or December. The next planned happy hour will be in January of next year. This of course is contingent upon obtaining a sponsor. If you know of any company who would like to sponsor, please direct them to the OWASP Austin Sponsorship page - https://owasp.org/www-chapter-austin/sponsorship.html. Thanks!
