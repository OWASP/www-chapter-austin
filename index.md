**Presentation: Why Your Security Metrics Suck, And How to Fix This**

Back in 2014, Rafal gave a talk about metrics, specifically on enterprise software security ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl7ZAR9U0xs ) and it's been haunting him ever since. He regularly gets emails and DMs from people asking him to help them with their security program metrics and given that it's been 10 years since he last presented this, it's time to revisit.

This talk focuses on metrics for security organizations in general, and AppSec related metrics in specific. In other words, how do security organizations measure their impact, and whether they're doing a "good job" or not? What do you measure, how do you measure it, and why does anyone care? Let's dive deep into a boring topic that nobody wants to talk about, but you all know you need to master.

**Presentation: PRESENTATION-NAME**

The Secure Development Lifecycle (SDL) is a powerful construct that can advance security for both organizations with established security practices by shifting left, and immature organizations seeking a framework to implement security best practices in agile development. NI has been on a journey over the last several years to improve the security of its products driven by customer requirements, their expectations, and increasingly, regulations that require software to be developed with secure methodologies. Security is as much about a mindset and development culture as it is about tools, vulnerabilities, and security technologies. Learn how NI’s adoption of the Secure Development Lifecycle has created a framework for addressing various security challenges in web applications, microservices, and infrastructure.
