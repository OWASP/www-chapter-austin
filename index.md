At this point in time we are continuing to plan for an in-person pre-conference training and conference, being optimistic that by October the situation will improve. However, we want to ensure we have alternative plans, such as making the training and the conference presentations virtual. With that in mind, we request that training and presentations be designed for conducting either in-person or virtual. If virtual, we will provide the necessary technical guidelines and assistance to trainers and presenters.*
