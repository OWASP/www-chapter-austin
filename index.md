**Title: CMD+CTRL: Web Application Cyber Range**
<blockquote>
Stuck at home, but still want to test your skills in identifying web app vulnerabilities?  OWASP Austin and Security Innovation invite all of Texas as members virtually compete in CMD+CTRL, a web application cyber range where players exploit their way through hundreds of vulnerabilities that lurk in business applications today.  Success means learning quickly that attack and defense is all about thinking on your feet. 
  <br><br>
For each vulnerability you uncover, you are awarded points. Climb the interactive leaderboard for a chance to win fantastic prizes! CMD+CTRL is ideal for development teams to train and develop skills, but anyone involved in keeping your organizationâ€™s data secure can play - from developers and managers and even CISOs.
