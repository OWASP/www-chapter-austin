**Where:** Online @ Zoom (RSVP at either link below to receive the URL)!

**Title: Mobile Security in a Remote World** 
<blockquote> 
  <br>
Attacks on the endpoint are no longer limited to traditional endpoints like laptops and workstations; mobile devices have been ranked the #1 hardest enterprise asset to defend. Compounded by bring-your-own device policies, enterprises are struggling to protect themselves against a growing variety of mobile threats. In this session, we will dive into the challenges with securing mobile in the enterprise security space and the evolution of mobile device security. Join us to learn about why attackers are shifting to target mobile, validated by investigations from the Cybereason Nocturnus team, and how the enterprise security industry is moving to address them.
</blockquote>

She has worked with multiple nonprofits to teach engineering to students and minorities, including the Global App Initiative and WISP, and has mentored business students at Hult Business School.

### LASCON 2020 ###

From the LASCON 2020 Planning Team:

It is with heavy heart that we are cancelling LASCON for 2020.

The highlight of LASCON has always been the community of people that meet for learning and sharing for the days of the conference.  Due to the uncertainty related to the coronavirus pandemic, the planning team has made the difficult decision to cancel LASCON for 2020 in its entirety.  While we did consider going virtual with the conference, we determined we could not provide the community atmosphere that makes LASCON special. We are now winding down LASCON for 2020 and looking ahead to LASCON in 2021.

All advance ticket purchases will be refunded in full, and funds will be credited back via the original method of purchase.  Sponsors will be contacted directly with additional details.

For those who have submitted their talks and training as part of our CFP and CFT, we want to express our appreciation of your willingness to contribute to LASCON 2020 and help to make it a successful event. While we will not have an event this year, we wish that you consider submitting your talk or training as part of our CFP and CFT for LASCON 2021 when we make those available.

Any questions should be directed to lascon@owasp.org

We thank you for all the support we receive from the community, and we look forward to hosting you once again for an awesome LASCON in 2021
