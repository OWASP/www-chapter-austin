**Presentation: Lead with AI: Transforming Cybersecurity with Artificial Intelligence**

The cybersecurity landscape is evolving at an unprecedented pace, with attackers leveraging automation, AI, and machine learning to outmaneuver traditional defenses. To stay ahead, we must rethink how we defend our systems, manage risk, and make critical decisions.

This talk will break down practical ways to integrate AI into security operations, from streamlining workflows to improving threat intelligence analysis. Attendees will gain a deeper understanding of AI’s strengths and limitations, ethical considerations, and how to build AI-driven strategies that empower security teams rather than overwhelm them.

**Presentation: PRESENTATION-NAME**

The Secure Development Lifecycle (SDL) is a powerful construct that can advance security for both organizations with established security practices by shifting left, and immature organizations seeking a framework to implement security best practices in agile development. NI has been on a journey over the last several years to improve the security of its products driven by customer requirements, their expectations, and increasingly, regulations that require software to be developed with secure methodologies. Security is as much about a mindset and development culture as it is about tools, vulnerabilities, and security technologies. Learn how NI’s adoption of the Secure Development Lifecycle has created a framework for addressing various security challenges in web applications, microservices, and infrastructure.
