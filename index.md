**What:** The Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour is a monthly event coordinated by the Austin OWASP and Capital of Texas ISSA Chapters and sponsored by various companies. We try to meet every second Thursday of the month from January to September (but occasionally we make schedule adjustments when needed).

### OWASP Austin Chapter Meeting<br>February 25, 2020 ###

Mopac.Building C (Directions: <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/National+Instruments/@30.4077179,-97.7268262,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x865b34c37397e56b:0x765d5bc26a58ce96" target="_blank">GoogleMaps</a>, <a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps?address=11500+N+Mo+Pac+Expy&amp;city=Austin&amp;state=TX&amp;zipcode=78759&amp;redirect=true" target="_blank">MapQuest</a>)

**Title:** Using Nmap's XSLT switch to better organize result scan data
<blockquote>

Nmap is an old-friend and one of the most-used tools in our box. On scans against large-scale networks, identifying ports with web applications might be easy using some common command line switches, but gathering the normal output to enumerate and identify targets is difficult. This talk is about using Nmap's XML output switch combined with customized XSLT documents to save time and organize the output in a format, such as CSV, that provides penetration testers with richer analysis capabilities or even HTML that is "report ready". We will look more closely at the XML output that Nmap provides (including NSE data) and learn how XSLT can be harnessed to derive usable custom documents.

This talk will have application to some or all of the following OWASP Testing procedures:
ASVS 9 Communication Security Requirements (9.1.1, 9.2.2)
OTG-INFO-004 Enumerate Applications on Web Server
OTG-CONFIG-006 Test HTTP Methods
OTG-CRYPST-001 Testing for Weak SSL/TLS Ciphers, Insufficient Transport Layer Protection
…others, as NSE scripts are applicable
and the Penetration Testing Execution Standard
