**Presentation: Advanced Account Security with Identity Threat Detection & Response**

Identity-related security challenges are more relevant than ever. As enterprises and consumers increasingly interact with a vast array of digital services, safeguarding accounts from compromise becomes a daunting task. Weak security measures not only expose businesses to financial loss and brand damage but also lead to unhappy customers. Identity Threat Detection and Response (ITDR) solutions offer a powerful way to reduce the risk of account fraud. In this insightful talk, we will explore typical account-related attacks illustrated with real-world examples. We will also discuss the critical non-functional requirements that make ITDR solutions truly effective.

<br>
**Presentation: PRESENTATION-NAME**

The Secure Development Lifecycle (SDL) is a powerful construct that can advance security for both organizations with established security practices by shifting left, and immature organizations seeking a framework to implement security best practices in agile development. NI has been on a journey over the last several years to improve the security of its products driven by customer requirements, their expectations, and increasingly, regulations that require software to be developed with secure methodologies. Security is as much about a mindset and development culture as it is about tools, vulnerabilities, and security technologies. Learn how NI’s adoption of the Secure Development Lifecycle has created a framework for addressing various security challenges in web applications, microservices, and infrastructure.
