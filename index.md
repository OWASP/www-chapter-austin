### OWASP Austin Chapter Meeting March 29th 2022 ###

**When:** Tuesday, March 29th, 2022 @ 12:00 AM - 1:00 PM

**Title: Application security: Where it all started, where it is now, and where we (hope to) see it in 20 years** 
<blockquote> 
Twenty years ago acclaimed venture capitalist, Ted Schlein at Kleiner Perkins, asked a question that changed Roger’s life and ultimately changed the way we look at Security. The two would eventually found Fortify Software, the pioneering company that introduced SAST and RASP technologies to the market. Fortify also led an important change in thinking, a so-called “shift left”, placing security responsibility into the realm of software development.  A lot has changed over those twenty years. In the early days, it was a challenge to give away software security solutions. Today, the leading software security companies are worth billions. Yet, problems still persist and the landscape for software development has become vastly more complex.  

In this talk, Roger will share experiences from the early days while working as Fortify’s co-founder & CTO and later in the RASP market as a board member and advisor to Prevoty. He will share advice and insights into how the market and the technologies started, how they have evolved and where they are headed. Roger and Ted are co-founders once again. They recently founded Ballistic Ventures - the early stage venture capital firm solely dedicated to cybersecurity entrepreneurs. In his new role, regularly meets leaders from both commercial industry and government to better understand their security challenges. He also sees fascinating ideas from cyber entrepreneurs on a daily basis. He will also share insights into the challenges that are the most fertile ground for a new generation of entrepreneurs.  He might even ask a question that changes your life too.
