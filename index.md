### OWASP Austin Chapter Meeting June 2025 ###

**When:** Tuesday, June 24, 2025 @ 11:30 AM - 1:00 PM<br>
Agenda:<br>
11:30-11:55 -- Room Opens, food is available and in-room discussions<br>
11:55-12:05 -- Chapter/OWASP info presentation<br>
12:05-1  -- Speaker Presentation<br>
<br>
**Presentation: SAST on Rewind: Moving from Pattern-Matching to Contextual Security in the Age of AI**

Static analysis was built for yesterday’s code. Its rule-based engines still hunt for familiar strings while AI assistants generate brand-new logic paths at record speed. The result? False positives everywhere, real vulnerabilities left open, and developers who treat security findings like background noise.

In this 40-minute session, James Wickett, CEO & Co-Founder of DryRun Security, hits “rewind” to show where traditional SAST got stuck—and fast-forwards to a context-first approach that finally keeps pace with modern development. Drawing on fresh data from the 2025 SAST Accuracy Report and real cod stories, James will:

<ol>
<li>Contrast patterns vs. context — why deterministic rules miss IDOR, broken auth, and AI-generated edge cases.</li>
<li>Unpack probabilistic scanning — how contextual signals cut noise without sacrificing coverage.</li>
<li>Contextual Security Analysis in Action — a live authorization flaw that slipped through regex nets.</li>
<li>Share a plan for AI readiness for AppSec — tools, projects, resources to plan for AI readiness for your appsec or product security program.</li>
</ol>
<br>
Attendees will leave with open-source resources, clear ROI talking points for leadership, and a practical roadmap to upgrade their AppSec program for the AI era—no VHS tape required.

Agenda:<br>
11:30-11:55 -- Room Opens, food is available and in-room discussions<br>

<br>
**Presentation: PRESENTATION-NAME**

The Secure Development Lifecycle (SDL) is a powerful construct that can advance security for both organizations with established security practices by shifting left, and immature organizations seeking a framework to implement security best practices in agile development. NI has been on a journey over the last several years to improve the security of its products driven by customer requirements, their expectations, and increasingly, regulations that require software to be developed with secure methodologies. Security is as much about a mindset and development culture as it is about tools, vulnerabilities, and security technologies. Learn how NI’s adoption of the Secure Development Lifecycle has created a framework for addressing various security challenges in web applications, microservices, and infrastructure.
